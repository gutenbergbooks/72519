<p>Our hero went to the Neilgherry Hills for
the remainder of his two months’ leave.
It is quite beyond my pen to describe that
lovely region, but in common with almost
all who have ever been there I have an
admiration amounting to a passion for the
Blue Hills. I declare them to be the most
salubrious, delightful, beautiful range in the
whole world. If I were to attempt a detailed
description of these most favoured
hills, I should fall so far short of their perfections<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
that I would only incur the wrath
and contempt of their many devoted admirers,
so I shall content myself by merely
giving a description of Sir Reginald’s
journey up the Ghaut.</p>

<p>He arrived at the foot of the hills early
one morning, having spent a night of heat,
mosquitoes, and consequent madness at
Mettapollium. He rode up by the old
road, which is nine miles to Coonor,
in preference to driving up the new
ghaut, a detour of sixteen miles. His
thoughts were exceedingly pleasant, and
he whistled uninterruptedly for the first
two miles; but after a while the beautiful
scenery he was passing through
engaged his attention entirely, and more
than once he stopped his horse and
looked about in amazed admiration.
“Oh, if Alice could only see it! If she
were here, what ecstasies she would be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
in!” was his frequent thought. As he
journeyed steadily up, the close tropical
vegetation was gradually left behind, the
trees assumed a more European aspect,
the air lost its thick steamy feel, and
became every instant more rarefied and
pure. The path appeared to wind in
and out through mountain-sides clothed
with trees and foliage of every description;
a foaming river was tearing headlong down
a wide rocky channel and taking frantic
leaps over all impediments. The scenery
was splendid. In spite of hunger and
fatigue, Sir Reginald felt as if he could
gaze and gaze for hours, and yet that his
eyes would scarcely be satisfied. Wild
roses and wild geraniums abounded on all
sides; enormous bunches of heliotrope
were growing between the stones; lovely
flowering creepers connected the trees, and
as to the ferns——!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span></p>

<p>The graves of several engineers who had
died when this old ghaut was being made
were passed—poor lonely graves! and yet
could those laid in them, so many thousands
of miles away from their native land,
desire to be buried in a more beautiful spot?</p>

<p>At one side towered the “Droog,” crowned
by Tippoo’s old fortress. The “Droog” itself,
a bold beetling hill facing south, and most
precipitous, seemed to stand as sentry to
this garden of India. From the top of it
you could look sheer down into the plains.
It was on the opposite side of the river
to the old ghaut, and a long day’s outing
from Coonor. On its summit were the gray
broken walls of the fort, very old and much
dismantled, and from which they say that
Tippoo, when in an angry mood, used to toss
his unhappy prisoners down to the plains
below. There it was that the Mahrattas made
their last stand against the British; and as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
they brought an enormous amount of treasure
up from their strongholds in the plains,
which treasure has never been recovered,
the “Droog” is considered a highly interesting
place for more reasons than one.
It is said that all the gold and jewels
were thrown down a well somewhere just
beyond the fort walls. One very old man
was supposed to know of its whereabouts,
but he would never divulge the secret, as
he said the spot was guarded by the ghosts—devils,
he called them—of many Mahratta
warriors, and he was afraid to incur their
displeasure.</p>

<p>Sir Reginald arrived in due time at
Coonor, and put up at an hotel, before
the windows of which there was a hedge
of heliotrope cut like box at home, and so
high and so dense, that you could ride at
one side of it, and someone else at the other,
without either being aware of their mutual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
proximity. It was one mass of flowers, and
smelt like ten thousand cherry-pies, and
was one of the sights of the Neilgherries.
Sir Reginald relaxed somewhat as regarded
society, made friends with the
other inmates of the hotel, and joined in
picnics to all the most celebrated views.
He was well known on the Toda Mund
as one of the best and most inveterate of
tennis-players, and carried off the first
prize in a tournament which took place
during his stay.</p>

<p>Touching the Toda Mund, there were
no Todas there then; they had long removed
themselves, with their black ringlets
and sheet clothing, to a more remote
region; but years previously the present
lawn-tennis-court ground had been the
home of generations of these extraordinary
people.</p>

<p>Sir Reginald returned to his regiment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
much the better for his trip, and received
the congratulations of his friends on his
improved appearance, and also on the
discovery he had made at Cheetapore;
as what had been the talk of all that
station naturally came to the ears of his
brother-officers, and they boldly conversed
of himself and his <i>wife</i> as if they had
known all along that he had been a
married man. The individual who had
been so contemptuously scouted when he
had declared that Fairfax was a Benedict
now found himself looked upon as a man
of unusual penetration—in short, a second
Daniel; and for a time his opinions were
quoted at at least ten per cent. above
their usual regimental value.</p>

<p>As for Fairfax himself, a change had
certainly come over the spirit of his dream.
He was an altered man; no more headlong
solitary rides, no more moping in his own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
quarters. Attired in faultless garb of undoubted
“Europe” origin, he was led, like a
lamb, to make a series of calls among the
chief notabilities of the place. “Better
late than never!” they mentally exclaimed
when his card was handed in, and being
assured that “Missus could see,” the hero
of the hour followed. His history was now
as well known as if it had been published
in <i>The Pioneer</i>, and the ladies of Camelabad
overwhelmed him with sympathy and
condolence, which he accepted with the
best grace he could muster; but he shrank
from speaking of his wife, save in the most
distant and general terms; and it was easy
to see that the mock certificate was a very
sore, distasteful subject.</p>

<p>As each succeeding mail came in he
said to himself, “Surely this will bring
a letter from Alice?” How he looked
forward to mail-days no one knew but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
himself; how buoyant were his spirits
every Saturday morning, how depressed
that same evening, when, tossing over
the newly-arrived letters on the anteroom
table, he would find one from Mark
Mayhew, one from his agent, and perhaps
one from his tailor, but not a line from
his wife. He heard from the Mayhews
that Alice had received and acknowledged
the confessions; and Mark, Helen, and
Geoffrey each sent him a long letter full
of indignation and congratulation. The
burden of each of these epistles was the
same, although couched in very different
style and language: it said, “Come home.”
“Whenever his wife endorsed their wishes,
he would leave Bombay by the following
mail.” This was what he said to himself
over and over again. Two months elapsed
and no letter came—not a line, not even
a message. After making allowance for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
every conceivable delay, he gradually and
reluctantly relinquished all hopes of the
ardently-desired missive, and came to the
conclusion that nothing now remained for
him to think but that she wished their
separation to be life-long.</p>

<p>One evening he mounted his horse and
galloped out alone to one of his former
favourite haunts, an old half-ruined
temple, about six miles from the cantonment.
Here he dismounted and tied his
Arab to a tree, saying to himself as he
ascended the steps: “There is no fear of
any interruption here, and I will make up
my mind to some definite plan before I
return to Camelabad this evening.” As he
paced up and down the empty echoing
ruin, he tried to judge between Alice and
himself as calmly and dispassionately as if
he were a third person. His own motives
and actions were easily explained, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
Alice’s were not so readily understood.
What could be the meaning of her extraordinary
conduct? His name had been
cleared, and she, who should never have
doubted him, and who, at any rate now,
ought to be the first to come forward,
had been dumb. There was but one
reasonable solution. “She did not know
her own mind when she was married;
she never cared two straws about me, and
she seizes the first pretext to free herself
from a distasteful union. So be it; she
<i>shall</i> be free,” he muttered. “I will hold
myself utterly aloof from her for the future.
I shall go home and live at Looton, and
surround myself with friends—shoot, hunt,
and lead as gay a bachelor life as if I
had no wife in existence. Why should I
expatriate myself for her sake?” he asked
himself aloud.</p>

<p>But on second thoughts this scheme did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
not prove so alluring. At Looton, every
room, every walk, every face would only
remind him of Alice.</p>

<p>“I could not stand it just yet,” he muttered;
“it is all too fresh, too recent; one
does not get over a thing like that so soon.
In a year or two, when I am thoroughly
hardened and indifferent, I will go; meanwhile
I shall remain in the service.”</p>

<p>The duties of his profession had their
charms for him; and the society of his
brother-officers was, he reflected, more
welcome and more necessary to him now
than ever. Weak he had always been
where Alice was concerned, but for once
he would be firm and be a man, and no
longer an infatuated fool, following the
<i>ignis fatuus</i> of a woman’s caprice.</p>

<p>As he stood on the steps of the temple,
watching the crimson sun that was slowly
sinking beyond the horizon and tinting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
the arid plains, the distant hills, the old
temple, and Reginald himself, with the
gorgeous hues of its departing splendour,
“That sun,” he exclaimed, as he watched
the last little red streak utterly disappear,
“has set on my folly and weakness; to-morrow
will find me, in one respect at
least, a different man. For the future
I will endeavour to forget that I ever had a
wife. I know it will be no easy matter to
banish her from my thoughts, but I shall
do my best. As a wife she is dead to
me in all but name; her indifference
shall be only rivalled by mine.” Query:
Was he not still thinking of her as he sat
for fully an hour, with his head resting
in his hands? He was endeavouring to
dig the grave of his love, and to bury
decently all the unfulfilled hopes he had
cherished for so long. The moon arose, owls
and bats made their appearance and flitted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
to and fro, apparently unconscious of the
silent figure on the temple steps. At
length the pawing and neighing of his
horse aroused him. He started up hastily,
pulled himself morally together, and hurried
down to the impatient steed, whom he
unfastened and mounted, and in another
moment was galloping away over the
moonlit midan, leaving the old temple to
the undisturbed possession of a veteran
hyena and a family of jackals.</p>

<p>The Seventeenth Hussars had expected,
as a sequel to his discovery at Cheetapore,
that Sir Reginald would have returned to
his ancestral halls as fast as steam could
take him.</p>

<p>But month after month went by, and
he still remained a fixture at Camelabad.
He carried out his mental resolution to
the letter, and left himself no leisure to
think of Alice or anyone else. He returned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
with the greatest energy to all his bachelor
amusements, kept a string of racers, hunted
the regimental pack, and made constant
shooting expeditions. He played whist till
the small hours, and entered into everything
with the greatest zeal; took a prominent
if somewhat mechanical part in all
the entertainments in the station, and was
voted “charming” by the ladies, both
young and old. Notwithstanding his
bachelor pursuits, he developed a curious
and Benedict-like interest in babies—a
species of humanity that he had hitherto
held in abhorrence. He cast more than
one inquisitive glance on the smaller fry in
arms as he went round the married quarters.
And Mrs. Gifford, the wife of the only
married captain in the Seventeenth, was
amazed when her ayah informed her that
“Sir Fairfax” had more than once taken
notice of her baby, “asking age, asking boy or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
girl, how soon walking?” It was most
flattering, if a little mysterious, and he
became a greater favourite than ever with
Mrs. Gifford. She was not aware that her
boy shone with a borrowed lustre in Sir
Reginald’s eyes for being almost the same
age as his son, and that the toys and
presents which were showered on him as he
grew older were not bestowed altogether for
his own sake.</p>

<p>A year after his visit to Cheetapore,
Sir Reginald received a letter in Alice’s
well-known writing. “It has come at
last,” he said to himself, as with trembling
hands he tore it open in his own bungalow.
He drew out the photo of a sturdy dark-eyed
cherub, enclosed in a sheet of blank
letter-paper. At first he could hardly
credit his senses; his indignation and his
bitter disappointment were too great for
words. His first impulse was to tear the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
photo into four pieces, but, mastering this
rather insane idea, he took it up and
looked at it closely instead. He was glad
he had not obeyed his first rash notion. The
boy was certainly a splendid little fellow.
Written in the corner of the carte was,
“Maurice E. Fairfax, aged thirteen months.”
He was something more tangible now, his
father thought, as he minutely studied
every feature. He felt a thrill of novel
and very pleasant pride as he looked at
the bright eager little face, and said to
himself: “This is my son. He has the
Fairfax eyes and brows, I believe,” he continued,
as he still studied the photo critically,
“but no one will deny that he has
his mother’s mouth.”</p>

<p>With a sigh he pieced together the torn
envelope, and looked in vain for a word;
the blank sheet of paper he scrupulously
turned over; it was really blank indeed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
He gazed at it for some time, as if there
were actually something written on it;
then, suddenly gathering himself together,
he carefully folded it up and put it along
with the photograph into the envelope, and
locked them away in his desk.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Sir Reginald had been nearly two years
at Camelabad when the outbreak which
had been simmering for some time in
Afghanistan came to boiling-point, and
the gauntlet of defiance was thrown down
by the Ameer.</p>

<p>Captains Campbell and Vaughan were
reposing in long chairs in front of their
mess, much exhausted with lawn-tennis,
refreshing themselves with copious iced
pegs, and enjoying a delightful experience
of the <i>dolce far niente</i> as embodied in
Bombay—chairs and brandies-and-sodas.</p>

<p>Suddenly a solitary horseman was seen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
madly careering across the midan, in the
direction of their lines.</p>

<p>“I say, just look at this fellow; his
horse has bolted!” said Captain Campbell.</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it,” replied his companion
serenely; “don’t you see that it’s Fairfax
on his chestnut, riding <i>ventre à terre</i>, as
usual?”</p>

<p>“Hallo, Fairfax, what’s up?” they
shouted as he approached. “Are the
barracks ablaze, and are you going for
the fire-engine?”</p>

<p>“Better than that,” he cried, clattering
into the compound. “I have just come
up from the general’s with glorious news—we
start for the front this day week.”</p>

<p>The Seventeenth Hussars were duly forwarded
to the frontier, and found that
their final destination was Dabaule, where
there was a good supply of grass and
water for their horses.</p>

<p>Owing to the approach of winter, there
was an utter stagnation of military
operations, and in spite of occasional small<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
raids on, and from, the neighbouring
Afridis, the time passed monotonously
enough. The weather was cold and
cheerless, but the officers of the Seventeenth,
headed by their junior major,
did their very best to provide exercise
and entertainment for their men and for
the camp in general.</p>

<p>Football, hockey, penny readings, and
theatricals were set going with remarkable
success, and helped to repel the encroachments
of idleness and <i>ennui</i>. The
surrounding scenery was quite different
to the tiresome succession of parallel ridges
presented by the ranges near the frontier.
Here hill and valley were thrown together
in the most admirable confusion, and
clothed with short stunted shrubs and
wild olives; gloomy pine-woods marked
out some of the hills in bold black
relief; the distant mountains were capped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
with snow, and the cold at times was
most intense. During the suspension of
hostilities there was ample leisure for
correspondence, and letter-writing was a
frequent resource on a dull gray afternoon.
The following is one of Sir Reginald’s
contributions to the mail-bag, written
on his knee by the light of a small bull’s-eye
lantern in the retirement of his seven-foot
tent:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
“Camp Dabaule.<br>
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Mark</span>,</p>

<p>“It is not my fault that there has
been such a tremendous gap in our correspondence.
I have written to you again
and again, and I once more seize the opportunity
of the mail-dâk passing through
to send you a few lines, and hope they
will meet with a better fate than my other
effusions, not one of which appears to have
reached you, judging by your incendiary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
letter. Doubtless they are in the hands
of those beggars the Afridis, who rob the
mails and cut the telegraph-wires continually.
We are all flourishing—men in
good spirits, horses in capital condition;
the only thing we ask is to be up and
doing. Cold weather has closed the passes
to a great extent, and there is nothing
whatever going on. To come into our
camp you would never dream that you
were in an enemy’s country, we have made
ourselves so completely at home, although
our accommodation is not magnificent. We
have all small hill-tents, weighing about
eighty pounds, in which there is just room
enough to turn round, and no more. We
all wear thick fur coats, called poshteens,
and fur caps, quite the Canadian style.
You would have some difficulty in recognising
me, I can tell you, were you told
to pick me out from among a dozen of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
fellows sitting round our favourite rendezvous—the
camp-fire. There is snow on
the ranges all round, and we have lots of
ice without troubling the ice-machines, but
hot grog is more the fashion than iced
champagne.</p>

<p>“We arrived here six weeks ago, <i>viâ</i>
the Khan Pass, and brought in, among
other prisoners, Hadji Khan, a notorious
robber and unmitigated rascal. We have
him in camp now. He has the most
diabolical expression I ever beheld; nevertheless,
the length and frequency of his
prayers are absolutely astounding. He
spends more than half the day on his
marrow-bones, no doubt consigning us, in
all generations, to Gehenna, if you know
where that is?</p>

<p>“The Afghans, take them all in all, are
a fine-looking set of men, with bigger
frames and fairer skins than the natives<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
of sunny Hindostan. Their physiognomy
is decidedly of the Jewish caste—piercing
black eyes and hooked noses, set off by
a resolute, not to say savage, expression
of death and extermination to all the
Feringhees!</p>

<p>“Now, this cold weather, they are
wrapped in poshteens, with or without
sleeves, of very dubious cleanliness. A
good serviceable garment descends from
generation to generation. An enormous
dark-blue puggaree encircling a little red
cap forms their turban. But the headman
of a village, in a richly-embroidered
poshteen, ‘the woolly side in,’ like the
immortal Brian O’Lynn—magnificent gold
and blue turban, and long silver-mounted
matchlock, is as handsome and picturesque
a looking fellow as you could wish to
see.</p>

<p>“I have not as yet had an opportunity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
of beholding an Afghan lady. Some of the
common women labour in the fields unveiled,
a weather-beaten, bold-looking set,
but the lady of the period conceals her
charms behind a long white arrangement,
that covers her from head to foot, like a
sheet; two holes cut for her eyes, and
covered with white net, give her a most
ghostly and ghastly appearance. She looks
like a she-‘familiar’ of the time of the
Inquisition.</p>

<p>“We have a capital mess here, and to
find such a dinner as our head kansamah
serves up, after whetting our appetites by
a twenty-mile ride, is a joy no words can
express. After the snows break up we
are sure to have a short bout of fighting,
and then the campaign will be over. The
English charger I got in Bombay has turned
out first-class—as hard as nails and up to
any amount of work. Many thanks to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
Helen for the Cardigan jacket and mittens.
My love to her and the <i>Limbs</i>.</p>

“<span class="smcap">R. M. Fairfax</span>.”<br>
</p>
</div>

<p>In April there was a general move on.
The camp at Dabaule was broken up, and
everyone was delighted to stretch themselves,
as it were, and resume the line of
march.</p>

<p>Very shortly afterwards a severe engagement
took place between the brigade and
a large body of Afghans. It resulted in
the total defeat of the latter. Their loss
amounted to one thousand, whilst the
English force had only three hundred
killed and wounded. The Afghans occupied
a large plateau protected by walls of
loose stones, and held an extremely strong
position. The English brigade consisted of
the Seventeenth Hussars, Fifth Goorkhas,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
Twenty-seventh N. I., Fortieth Sikhs, and
a battery of artillery. The enemy behaved
with the most determined courage, rabble
horde as they were; some merely armed
with long knives and yataghans, some
carrying the dear familiar Jazail, and some—oh,
proud and happy men!—the British
Enfield rifle. They were led by a man
on a powerful black horse, who wore a
prodigious green turban, and had his face
whitened with ashes or some such substance.
He was a very holy moolah, and
harangued the multitude with an energy
and vehemence only surpassed by his wild
and frenzied gesticulations. Beside him
stood his standard-bearer, carrying a large
green flag with a red border and red inscription;
and in spite of a heavy fire
from the infantry, this enormous force of
undisciplined fanatics advanced with the
utmost steadiness and resolution. The order<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
to charge was given to the hussars, who bore
down like a whirlwind, led by Sir Reginald
Fairfax—the colonel was <i>hors de combat</i>
with typhoid fever—who, mounted on a
gallant English thoroughbred, cleared the
low wall, and was soon laying about him
in all directions.</p>

<p>He wrested the standard from the hands
of its bearer, and striking him a tremendous
blow with its iron pole, laid him low, but
was speedily surrounded by some furious
fanatics, resolved to regain their colours
at any cost. His horse was shot under him;
however, quickly disengaging himself, sword
in hand, and still grasping the green flag,
he made a valiant stand against half-a-dozen
moolahs, with his back to some
broken masonry. It would have gone hard
with him had not some of his men charged
down to his rescue and beaten off the
moolahs, who in another moment would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
have made a vacancy in the Seventeenth
Hussars and left Lady Fairfax a widow.
Rid of his immediate adversaries, Sir
Reginald seized a riderless horse, and
making over the standard to a gunner,
was soon pursuing the flying enemy, who,
unable to withstand the cavalry charge,
had wavered, broken, and fled; being,
moreover, utterly demoralised by the loss
of their standard, which they looked upon
as their “oriflamme,” and as a kind of
holy talisman, the very sight of which
alone would make the hearts of the
Feringhees quail. So much had been promised
on its behalf by an aged fakir,
who had delivered it over to his countrymen
with many prayers and profound
solemnity. And it was gone—taken from
their very midst by a black-hearted Kaffir,
who fought like the Prince of Darkness
himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span></p>

<p>The flying Afghans, scattered all over
the plain, were pursued and ridden down
by the cavalry; but the prize all sought
to capture—the fakir on the black Turcoman—set
every effort at defiance, and,
thanks to his magnificent horse, effected
his escape with almost provoking ease.
Yaboos, laden with dead Afghans, were
driven off the field with miraculous
celerity, and within an hour from the
firing of the first shot the plain was
deserted.</p>

<p>For the capture of the standard “and
displaying conspicuous gallantry on the
field of action,” Sir Reginald was recommended
for the Victoria Cross, a distinction
his friends granted him ungrudgingly.</p>

<p>He was a born soldier, that was very evident.
The Fairfaxes had always had a drop
of wild blood in their veins. With him it
took the form of fighting, instead of—as in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
his ancestors’ times—dicing, drinking, and
duelling. His men worshipped him, and
would willingly have followed him at any
time and to any place, were it to the very
gates of Hades itself.</p>

<p>“It’s the good old blood that tells in
the long run,” remarked a trooper to his
comrade over his beer and pipe. “Such
a glutton for fighting as this ’ere major of
ours I never did see.”</p>

<p>At any rate, whatever was the reason,
such an officer in camp and such a leader
in the field inspired their utmost devotion
and enthusiasm.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Although Hafiz Khan and his hordes
were defeated and dispersed, they speedily
rallied sufficiently to be a ceaseless thorn
in the flesh to the brigade now permanently
encamped within a few miles of the
late scene of action. Hafiz was a striking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
illustration of the saying, “He who fights
and runs away will live to fight another
day.” He was a fakir—exceptionally holy,
having made the blessed pilgrimage no less
than thrice—notorious alike for his zealous
piety as for his abhorrence of the accursed
Kaffir. Scandal whispered that he had not
<i>always</i> been such a devoted servant of the
Prophet; that for years he lived in ill-odour
among his neighbours, owing to his
constant appropriation of their flocks and
herds. Whatever may have been the truth,
he was now an ardent patriot, and preyed
on the Feringhees instead of on his friends.
He was a most daring and successful
raider, and covered himself with glory,
notably on one occasion when he carried
off seven hundred head of cattle from
Jellalabad.</p>

<p>He cut off more convoys and slaughtered
more grass-cutters and camel-drivers than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
any other leader between Cabul and the
Khyber; and his depredations were so
secretly and skilfully carried out, that his
very name alone inspired the stoutest-hearted
camp-follower with terror.</p>

<p>Invariably mounted on his superb black
Turcoman, he gave chase or effected his
retreat with a speed that set everything at
defiance. His horse was known by the
name of “Shaitan,” and was supposed to
be in direct communication with the Evil
One, being imported expressly from the
lower regions for the purpose of hunting down
the infidels. The rider of this desirable
mount was an elderly thick-set man,
wearing a gigantic green turban, so large
as almost to conceal his features. Still his
hooked nose, fierce hawk eye, and bushy
beard were visible; and the treacherous,
cruel, malignant expression of his face was
such as a devil might have envied. Armed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
with a pair of horse-pistols and a formidable
yataghan, he headed a band of followers
varying from fifty to two thousand, and
infested an area of many miles in extent.
His patriotic zeal had no bounds; he was
known to have recently butchered an entire
village, merely because the headman had
supplied (under strong pressure) cattle and
grain to the English commissariat; in short,
his name far and near was a byword for
ferocity and fanaticism.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>One evening, Sir Reginald and his two
friends, Captain Vaughan and Mr. Harvey,
went for a short ride in the neighbourhood
of their camp, the former mounted on his
first charger, an unusually large, powerful
Arab, the two latter on stout Yarkundi
ponies. All were clad in Karki suits, and
carried (a most necessary precaution) revolvers
in their belts. The country around<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
was reported clear. Hafiz and his faction
were said to be miles away. Certainly
nothing had been heard of them for two
whole days. It was a lovely evening, and
tempted by the odd wild scenery they
extended their ride farther than they had
previously intended. At sunset they found
themselves close by a straggling Mohammedan
cemetery, whose large square tombs
were thickly crowded together, some of
them richly carved, some of them poor
and plain. The graveyard was planted
with magnificent cypresses, now casting
long, long shadows in the setting sun. A
solemn melancholy silence hung around the
place; even the mud hovel, usually inhabited
by the guardian fakir, was empty—a
huge Afghan dog, with closely-cropped
ears and tail, lay in front of the open
doorway, sleeping on his post.</p>

<p>“Do you know that they say there is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
a Christian grave somewhere quite close to
this?” said Sir Reginald, looking round.
“I wonder they buried him so near to
these people,” nodding his head in the
direction of the cemetery.</p>

<p>“Yes,” returned Mr. Harvey; “but it
was probably done with an idea that he
would like some company.”</p>

<p>“Defend me from the company of an
Afghan, dead or alive,” returned his brother-officer,
walking his horse on to where he
commanded a view of the fourth side
of the graveyard. His two friends followed
him, and another second brought
in sight a grave and plain stone cross,
about a hundred yards to their right.
Standing beside it was the fakir, in close
and earnest conversation with no less a
person than Hafiz himself—Hafiz, mounted
as usual on his black Turcoman, and <i>alone</i>!
Both had their backs turned to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
cemetery, and stood facing the setting sun,
deeply absorbed in conversation, which
they emphasized from time to time with
vehement and almost frenzied gesticulation.
Evidently they were hatching some
evil deed.</p>

<p>“Hafiz, by all that is lucky!” exclaimed
Sir Reginald, drawing out his revolver
and putting his horse into a sharp canter.
But between him and the fakirs ran a
deep nullah, and ere he reached its bank
they were both aware of the presence of
the three hussars.</p>

<p>Hafiz paused for a second to glare at
the intruders, then raising one arm to
heaven, with a loud invocation to Allah, he
turned and spat on the cross beneath him
with a gesture of the utmost abhorrence
and contempt, and wheeling his horse half
round, with a derisive farewell to his foes,
he started off at full gallop. This outrageous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
insult to their faith and nation
affected the three Englishmen variously.
Captain Vaughan, who was of rather full
habit, became absolutely purple with
passion; Mr. Harvey relieved his feelings
with several round oaths; Sir Reginald said
nothing, but his lips tightened under his
dark moustache in a way that was ominous
enough. With a vicious dig of the spurs
he forced his horse down the rugged sides
of the nullah, up the opposite bank, and
away across the plain in hot pursuit of
the holy man. The two Yarkundis, urged
to the very top of their speed, joined
neck and neck in the chase for a short
distance, but endurance, not pace, was
their <i>forte</i>, and they soon ceased to
answer to the repeated applications of their
riders’ spurs and Annamullay canes, and
began to lag behind the free-going Arab.</p>

<p>“It’s no use, Fairfax,” shouted Captain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
Vaughan, pulling up; “you’ll never overtake
him.”</p>

<p>“I will!” he returned, looking back for
a second. “I’ll catch him and kill him,
if I follow him to Candahar.”</p>

<p>His friends’ remonstrances were given to
the winds; he had already distanced them
by a hundred yards, and soon he and
the far-receding fakir became mere specks
in the distance, and rounding the spur
of a hill, were completely lost to sight.</p>

<p>The two officers waited impatiently for
the sound of shots, but the silence that
reigned around them remained unbroken,
save for the distant cry of the jackal
setting out on his nightly career, and
seeming to say more distinctly than usual:
“I smell dead white men, I smell dead
white men.”</p>

<p>The whistle of a kite sailing homewards
was the only other sound that broke the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
dead surrounding stillness. The sun had
set; ten minutes previously it had vanished
below the horizon in the shape of a little
red speck; gray twilight was rapidly
spreading her mantle over hills and plains,
and our two friends, finding they had
completely lost sight of their hot-headed
companion, reluctantly turned their ponies’
heads homewards, and retailed their adventure
to their comrades round the camp-fire.
These listened to it with many interruptions
of surprise and dismay.</p>

<p>“Fairfax was splendidly mounted; that
Arab of his was one of the best horses
out of Abdul Rahman’s stables, that’s some
comfort,” remarked one.</p>

<p>“Yes, he was evidently gaining on the
Turcoman when we saw the last of him,”
returned Mr. Harvey; “but, for all we
know, Fairfax has galloped straight into
the Afghan camp.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span></p>

<p>“I had no idea he was such a Quixotic
fool,” growled a grizzly-headed colonel,
angrily kicking the logs in front of him.
“It would not surprise <i>me</i> if we never
saw him again.”</p>

<p>Some said one thing, some another,
but all agreed in feeling very grave uneasiness
on behalf of their brother-officer.</p>

<p>The mess-bugle sounded and was responded
to, dinner was disposed of, and
still Fairfax did not appear. Meanwhile
Sir Reginald, once lost to sight, had been,
as Mr. Harvey remarked, overtaking Hafiz
at every stride. The Turcoman had done
a long day’s march, and, though urged by
his rider to great exertions, was no match
for the well-bred Arab in his wake. The
distance between them diminished gradually
but surely. The black horse was only
leading by thirty yards when Hafiz turned
and glanced over his shoulder. It <i>was</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
as he had fancied, the very selfsame Kaffir
who had taken the sacred standard. They
were within half a mile of the Rohilla
headquarters, and Allah had surely given
him over for a prey into his hand. But
his horse was failing, and the Feringhee
would soon be at his girths. Best finish
the matter at once. Reining up suddenly,
he faced the approaching horseman with
astonishing celerity, and drawing a pistol,
which he aimed for half a second, he fired
at him point-blank. The bullet missed
its intended destination and buried itself
deep in the brain of the Arab charger,
who with one frantic convulsive bound fell
forward dead on the sand, and the fakir,
with drawn yataghan, charged down on the
dismounted hussar, determined to have his
life.</p>

<p>But, Hafiz, your evil star was in the
ascendant. Had you but known, you would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
have been far wiser to have ridden off
and left your foe to find his way back
to camp on foot, and to take his chance
of being murdered by your prowling
countrymen.</p>

<p>With an expression of fiendish hatred
the fakir rode at Sir Reginald, his uplifted
weapon ready to descend with fatal
effect. But he had to contend with a
man of half his age and ten times his
activity, who sprang at him and seized
his arm, and in so doing broke the
force of the blow, which, instead of
sweeping off our hero’s head, as intended,
merely inflicted a flesh wound in his
shoulder, and before Hafiz had time to
recover himself, a bullet from Sir Reginald’s
revolver found a lodging in his breast.
Swaying heavily backwards and forwards,
his powerless hands dropped reins and
weapon, and he fell from his saddle like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
a sack; and our hussar, catching the
Turcoman by the bridle and disengaging
his late master from the stirrup, sprang
on his back, turned his head in the direction
of the English camp, and rode off
at the top of his speed.</p>

<p>His practised ear had caught the sounds
of approaching hoofs, attracted doubtless
by the shots; but still he had a start of
fully a quarter of a mile, and made the
very most of it. Infuriated Pathans rode
hard upon his track, and it was not till he
was well within the lines of the English
picket, and saw their camp-fires blazing,
that he ventured to draw rein and allow
the exhausted Turcoman to proceed at a
walk. It does not often happen to a horse
to have to carry two successive riders
flying for their lives within the same hour.
Shaitan’s drooping head and heaving sides
bore witness to a hard day’s work, as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
was led by his new owner within the bright
circle of light thrown by the officers’ camp-fire.</p>

<p>Exclamations, remonstrances, and questions
were volleyed at Sir Reginald as once
more he stood among his friends, bare-headed
and ghastly pale, with the bridle
of the notorious black charger hanging
over one arm. Very brief were the
answers he vouchsafed to half-a-dozen
simultaneous interrogations.</p>

<p>“Hafiz was badly wounded, if not dead.
He was not likely to trouble them for
some time, if ever; his own charger was
lying on the plain with a bullet in his
brain, and affording a fine supper for the
jackals. Yes, he had had to ride for it
coming back, and the black was pretty
well done.” Here, as he came nearer to
the logs, it was seen that one sleeve of
his Karki coat was soaked in blood. Questions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
were immediately at an end, and he
was hurried off by the doctor to have his
wounds looked to, in spite of his urgent
disclaimers and assurances “that it was a
mere scratch.”</p>

<p>The Turcoman, the sight of which acted
on the Afghans as a red rag to a turkey-cock,
soon became accustomed to an English
bit and an English rider, and made his
new master a most valuable second charger.
Many were the attempts to recover him,
to shoot him, to get him from his abhorred
Kaffir owner at any price, but all efforts
were futile, he was much too well guarded.
When Sir Reginald was invalided home,
he was sent down to Bombay with his
other horses, and sold for a very high
price to a hard-riding Member of Council;
and doubtless the destination of the once
feared and honoured “evil one” will be
to end his days in a Bombay buggy.</p>

<p>Beyond constant and most wearisome
convoy duty, the Seventeenth Hussars
had very little to do. Afghanistan is a
country more adapted for mountaineers
than mounted men; and as far as downright
fighting was concerned, the cavalry
were, perforce, idle. Sir Reginald looked
upon “baggage guard” as better than
nothing. “Half a loaf was better than no
bread,” and he had more than one exciting
little brush with would-be marauding
and murdering Pathans.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span></p>

<p>Repeatedly successful raids and small
skirmishes had given him a most unenviable
notoriety among the tribes of banditti
who infested the various camel-roads and
swarmed about the hills. To these he was
a perfect scourge, and hunted them and
harried them with unwearied energy. It
is not too much to say that they literally
thirsted for his blood. Although often
warned by his brother-officers that he
would be “potted,” his daring and foolhardiness
knew no bounds. He would
loiter behind, or canter on in advance of
a squadron, as coolly as if he were riding
on an English high-road, and not through
a gloomy Afghan pass, among whose rocks
more than one enemy was sitting patiently
behind his Jazail or Snider, waiting to work
off any straggling Kaffirs, and so to earn
for himself an honourable name.</p>

<p>Sir Reginald appeared to bear a charmed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
life, and thoroughly to carry out the good
old Irish motto, “Where there’s no fear
there’s no danger;” and though he had
one or two narrow escapes, he exemplified
another saying in his own person, viz.,
“That a miss is as good as a mile.”</p>

<p>The tribes in the neighbourhood of the
division to which the hussars belonged
had been giving a great deal of trouble,
and displaying their hostility in various
acts, such as constantly waylaying convoys
and cutting off camel-drivers and grass-cutters.
Things came to such a pitch that
it was determined to bring these wretches
to their senses, and a small but compact
body was despatched to punish them. It
consisted of three squadrons of the Seventeenth,
six companies of the Two hundred
and seventh, about fifty sappers, and three
Gatling guns. In moving a larger force
there was a difficulty about supplies, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
the pace had to be regulated in exact proportion
to that of the yaboos with the
column; and it was heart-breaking work
to keep the poor beasts going.</p>

<p>The march lay at first through a narrow
rocky gorge, which, after two hours’ steady
advance, opened into a wide flat valley
that showed abundant evidence of cultivation,
including many fields of wheat.</p>

<p>Two or three villages were reached, and
proved to be empty; their inhabitants,
having had timely warning, had removed
themselves and their belongings, and were
concealed among the surrounding hills.
Late in the afternoon a march of twelve
miles brought the troops to the large and
important village of Ritsobi. The inhabitants
had not long left; but a few
sacks of bhoosa, some household cooking-pots,
and one or two native ploughs were
all that could be discovered; and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
soldiers were forced to content themselves
with their usual rations, instead of the
fowls, eggs, and fruit of which they had
had visions.</p>

<p>The two village towers were speedily
mined and blown up, and the wooden
houses were easily levelled, and afforded
capital fuel for the camp-fires, an unusual
number of which were soon blazing in all
directions.</p>

<p>Standing at the smallest of one of these
fires was Sir Reginald Fairfax, earnestly
questioning two Belooch sepoys, who, got
up as fakirs, had been playing the part of
spies among the enemy. The latter were
assembled in formidable numbers about ten
miles distant, and meant to hold their
ground and await the advance of the
column. To look at Sir Reginald as he
stood in the firelight, one spurred boot
resting on a log of wood, his face and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
attitude indicating how wholly absorbing
he found the sepoys’ information, no one
would believe that he had a thought in
the world apart from his profession. The
bright roaring planks lit up his face, already
kindled with the news, and the eager,
questioning officer before us was as different
to the moody, cynical Major Fairfax
of Camelabad as night from day.</p>

<p>In spite of hard fare, no better than a
trooper’s; in spite of being all day in the
saddle and half the night on the alert,
he had never looked better or cheerier.
His constitution appeared to be of iron,
and he was perfectly indifferent to cold or
heat, hunger or fatigue; or if not, it was
assumed that he was. His spirits and
energy were untiring. The discomforts of
camp life he treated as an excellent joke,
and after dining heartily on ration beef
and dry bread, and having kept the company<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
entertained with his stories, sallies,
and toasts, he would turn in to his seven-foot
tent, wrap himself in his military
cloak, and with his saddle for a pillow
sleep the sleep of the just.</p>

<p>It was determined by the officer in command
to steal a march on the enemy, and
the force were under orders to set out that
night. About one o’clock all the camp was
astir. The moon had gone down, but
the stars shone brightly—not sufficiently
brightly however to make travelling pleasant,
particularly for the cavalry, as the
road was cut up by various watercourses
and nullahs, in which more than one gallant
hussar came to grief, and fished himself
out with imprecations loud and deep.</p>

<p>After marching about eight miles the
column came in sight of the enemy’s fires,
and a halt was made till there was sufficient
light to advance. As soon as the first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
streaks of dawn became visible above the
horizon the cavalry were ordered to the
front, and shortly afterwards shots were
heard, followed by a rush of hoofs, betokening
the flight and pursuit of the
picket.</p>

<p>Two miles farther on the force reached
a kotal, from whence they could see the
valley beneath them. It lay before them,
but not “smiling”—it was sprinkled with
large bodies of the enemy, armed to the
teeth, who, with standards flying and drums
beating, were evidently sounding the tocsin
of war. The column halted on a ridge as
they saw the Ghazis slowly advancing, and
bringing their guns to the front tried the
effect of a few shells. The result was
excellent. The enemy began to sheer off
towards the hills, gradually retiring up the
valley. Their movements were so rapid
that the cavalry vainly manœuvred to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
bring them to close quarters; they continued
a steady but dignified retreat until
they reached a large walled village about
three miles up the valley, embedded in
hillocks and groves of chunar trees. From
rocks and other coigns of vantage a smart
fire was opened by the enemy. The
Afghan Snider is by no means a bad weapon,
and cartridges from the Balar Hissar are not
to be despised. Numerous isolated cragsmen
among the rocks around the village made
very good practice, but the main body
of the enemy rounded the base of a hill
and completely disappeared. It was generally
supposed that they had skedaddled,
but this was soon found to be a mistake.
It was merely a feint to draw the Feringhees
nearer to the village, in order that they
might have the benefit of an enormous
gun, or kind of matchlock, fired from
rests in the ground. The first time it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
was fired the proprietors set up a deafening
cheer that echoed and re-echoed among the
neighbouring hills in quite a startling
manner. A second time it fired, a second
hideous shout; then the three Gatlings
were brought into play, and it was very
quickly shut up. At the first two shots
from these—to the Afghans, wholly novel
inventions—they were too astounded to
move; the next two sent them flying in
all directions. They seemed to melt away
like snow before the sun. Suddenly from
behind a hillock a large body of cavalry
appeared, and charged irregularly but at
full gallop, very pluckily led by a man on
a spotted horse, who cheered them on with
loud shouts of “Kaffir! kaffir!” The
hussars, only too delighted to respond to
the call, were among them in a twinkling,
and the affair was soon cut up into a series
of hand-to-hand encounters, in which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
irregular cavalry got much the worst of
it, although they fought with the utmost
fury and determination. The superior arms
and weight of the hussars was more than
they could contend against; they were
scattered, put to flight, and for a short
distance hotly pursued. The hussars had
eleven men wounded and a number of
horses lost or disabled; this was the
extent of their casualties. The defeat of
their cavalry completed the discomfiture
of the enemy, and the village was our
own. The whole place was strewn with
property left behind by its owners in their
hasty retreat. The soldiers had fine times,
for each of them had at least one fowl
strung to his belt and an unlimited supply
of fruit and vegetables. The idea of pursuing
the flying foe had to be relinquished;
they had taken to the surrounding rocky
hills, which they climbed with goatlike<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
agility, and as chamois-hunting on horseback
was beyond the ability <i>even</i> of the
Seventeenth Royal Hussars, they were
allowed to continue their flight unmolested.
One Ghazi, however, having reached what
<i>he</i> considered a safe elevation, turned and
waved his white standard most insolently
at the little force below; but a bullet from
a Henry-Martini “dropped him,” and put
a fatal termination to him and his evolutions.
The infantry now spread all over
the village and proceeded to fire it. Several
of the larger buildings were already in a
blaze, and many surrounding stacks of
corn had been given to the flames, when
an incident occurred which nearly cost
Sir Reginald his life.</p>

<p>As he was cantering down a narrow
dusty lane, he observed two men with pick-axes
standing in evident hesitation before
the closed door of a large square house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span></p>

<p>Reining up his horse sharply, he asked
what they were about.</p>

<p>“Beg pardon, sir,” replied one of them,
saluting him, “but they say as ’ow the
’ouse is full of Hafghans, all harmed,
and we are waiting for a party of the
Two hundred and seventh before we venture
inside, in case what they say is true.”</p>

<p>“We will soon see,” exclaimed Sir Reginald,
jumping off his horse and giving the door a
vigorous kick—an old rotten door it was—and
another kick sent it flying open. An ill-directed
volley from several Jazails greeted
the intruder, and five Ghazis, armed with
tulwars, made for the street.</p>

<p>One of the shots had taken effect in
Sir Reginald’s left arm, and, parrying a
desperate tulwar cut with his revolver, he
closed with his assailant; but a frightful
blow from the heavy stock of a native gun,
delivered from behind, knocked him down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
insensible, and a Ghazi was just about to
give him the <i>coup de grâce</i> with a long
Afghan knife when the sappers and infantry
burst in and overpowered the inhabitants,
making very short work of them with
bayonet and revolver.</p>

<p>The struggle in which Sir Reginald had
been engaged had not lasted more than half
a minute, and when his men came up to
the scene of action and found him to all
appearance dead, their fury and grief knew
no bounds. Two wounded Ghazis, who had
been granted quarter, relinquished all hopes
of life when they saw the many fierce and
murderous looks that were turned on them;
and when the general, his aide-de-camp,
and one of the officers of the hussars
came galloping up, and they saw their
faces and gestures of consternation, they felt
the gratifying conviction that at any rate
they had killed a Kaffir of some importance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span></p>

<p>He certainly looked as if he was dead
as he lay in the narrow little street with
his head resting on the knee of his brother-officer.
His eyes were closed, over his face
the pallor of death seemed already to be
creeping. His blue and gold uniform was
torn and disfigured with dust and blood,
and his left arm hung by his side in such
a helpless unnatural position that it did not
need a second glance to see that it was
badly broken. However, he was <i>not</i> dead,
only badly wounded and insensible. He
was carried in a dhooly to the permanent
camp (a two days’ march), and the several
doctors with the brigade held a consultation
on his case, whilst his anxious friends,
brother-officers and men alike, hung round
the tent waiting for the verdict. Great was
their relief to hear that, if fever did not
supervene, there was nothing serious to be
apprehended, but that it would be many a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
day before Sir Reginald would again wield
a sabre.</p>

<p>Still, for some time his state was very
precarious, and many were the inquiries
that beset the medical officer in attendance
on the patient. He was a short, round-about,
elderly man, with beetling brows
and a gruff voice, but underneath his
rough, rude exterior there lurked a really
kind heart.</p>

<p>As he was leaving the hospital one
morning he was accosted by two of the
“boys” of the Seventeenth, who overwhelmed
him with anxious inquiries.</p>

<p>“How is Fairfax this morning?” they
asked in a breath.</p>

<p>The doctor rubbed his chin and looked
at them reflectively; the two youths were
connected in his mind with reminiscences
of not an altogether agreeable nature, one
of them, who bore the <i>sobriquet</i> of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
“Buttons,” being about the cheekiest and
coolest young gentleman he had ever come
across, and both displayed an extraordinary
aptitude for practical jokes.</p>

<p>“He is not going to give you a step
<i>this</i> time,” replied the doctor brusquely,
preparing to pass on.</p>

<p>“A step! I would not <i>take</i> it if he
did,” returned Buttons vehemently, standing
right in front of the doctor.</p>

<p>“Oh, not you,” retorted the medico,
scornfully. “Fairfax would—nay, if he has
a relapse, will—give three steps. As things
are now, a man must stand on his comrade’s
grave for promotion, and you are just the
very last young gentleman to keep yourself
in the background. You would take
the step sharp enough if you got the
chance, and were not passed over!”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about stepping on Fairfax’s
grave, as you call it,” replied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
Buttons, crimson with anger; “but I
know some people’s graves I could dance
on with pleasure,” accompanying the remark
with a look of the utmost significance.</p>

<p>“Ah, you don’t really mean it? Why
are you all in such a desperate state about
this fellow? Why is <i>he</i> singled out as an
object of so much anxiety and attention?
Generally, when a man dies up here, it is
not ‘Poor So-and-so is dead, I’m awfully
sorry,’ but ‘So-and-so is dead—what kind
of a kit had he?’ And away you all tear
and bid for his things before the breath is
hardly out of his body! Why such great
concern about this young major? He has
a first-class kit, as kits go, and a couple of
good sound horses.”</p>

<p>“You are quite a new-comer, Dr.
Bennett,” said the other hussar, who had
not hitherto spoken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span></p>

<p>“Only a recent arrival,” very loftily,
“or you would not talk like this.”</p>

<p>“Fairfax keeps us all going;” then
warming to his subject, “he is the best
fellow in the world, always thinking for
others, always doing the work of three.
He looks after the men; he manages the
mess; he——”</p>

<p>“Ah, <i>now</i> I can understand your
anxiety,” interrupted Dr. Bennett, contracting
his fierce brows. “The light breaks
at last! The squalid feeding that is set
before us, the horribly mysterious joints and
leather steaks, are now accounted for. The
mess butler has it all his own way now
that the mess president is sick?”</p>

<p>“You are quite welcome to adopt this
view of the subject if you like,” said hussar
number two very angrily; “to <i>some</i> people
their food is their only object of interest.”</p>

<p>“Well, well,” said the doctor, surveying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
the two wrathful young faces before him,
and bursting into a loud laugh, “I must
try and patch up this interesting patient of
mine for many reasons, chiefly because he
understands the art of snubbing bumptious
boys and keeping them in their places. I
am sure it is a mercy that someone can
control them, for it is a task that is utterly
beyond <i>me</i>,” muttered the gallant surgeon-major,
as he walked rapidly away to his
eagerly-anticipated breakfast.</p>

<p>There had been a struggle among Sir
Reginald’s friends for the post of chief
nurse; but his own man Cox would not
yield the place to anyone, and they found
their would-be office a sinecure. An excellent,
firm, and gentle nurse himself, a worse
patient than Sir Reginald could scarcely be
found! So impatient of being kept in bed,
so restless in it—tossing and tumbling to
and fro, regardless of his wounded arm.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
Perfectly deaf to all blandishments that
induced him to take proper medicine and
nourishment, he would have his own way,
and he had it, driving his nurses to their
wits’ end and throwing himself into a
fever.</p>

<p>One night, at the very height of his
illness, when he was lying in a kind of
stupor, the doctor came in on his way
from mess and felt his pulse and temperature.
Standing at the foot of the camp-bed,
he eyed his patient dubiously for some
moments.</p>

<p>“This will never do,” he said, after an
ominous silence. “If he goes on like this
he will slip through our fingers. His
pulse and temperature are past counting.
I am afraid he is in a bad way, poor
fellow! Some of you had better write
to his friends this mail and prepare them.
He may pull through, but the chances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
are very much the other way. I’ll look in
again in the course of an hour or two.”
So saying, without waiting for a reply of
any kind, he turned on his heel and
departed.</p>

<p>Captain Vaughan and Mr. Harvey declared
over and over to each other that
they did not agree with the doctor, but
each made a mental reservation to himself:
“Their patient was certainly <i>not</i>
mending.” As they glanced anxiously
towards him, they were more than ever
struck by his worn and sunken features,
his hurried, laboured breathing, and the
startling contrast between his dark hair
and the ghastly paleness of his face.
“Wali,” Sir Reginald’s Afghan dog, a great
shaggy monster, something like a collie,
with dark-gray coat and pointed ears, sat
on his haunches, with his nose resting
on the bed, surveying his master with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
grave inquiring eyes. To judge from his
solemn sorrowful face, he thought as
badly of the patient as did his human
friends. The two officers had not forgotten
the doctor’s injunction, and proceeded
to search over the tent for keys,
desk, letters, and addresses. They found
a small and most unpresuming little
leather desk, which they turned out and
ransacked. It contained paper and envelopes,
some letters, and a cheque-book,
but not one of the letters was in a lady’s
hand, or bore the signature of Fairfax.
After some discussion they agreed to
write to the Honorable Mark Mayhew,
who seemed a frequent correspondent.
As they were tumbling out the contents
of the desk they came upon a cabinet
photograph, a half-length likeness of a
slender girl in a white dress, with a smile
in her eyes, and a fox-terrier in her arms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span></p>

<p>“Hullo!” exclaimed Mr. Harvey, stooping
to pick up the carte from where
it had fallen on the floor, face upwards.
“I say, who is this?” regarding the
treasure-trove with wide-open eyes.</p>

<p>“That is his <i>wife</i>!” replied Captain
Vaughan, looking over his comrade’s
shoulder. “Is she not lovely?”</p>

<p>“Lovely indeed!” replied Mr. Harvey,
refusing to let the photo out of his
hand, and gazing at it with the eyes
of a connoisseur. “I don’t wonder now
that Fairfax turned up his nose at the
pale-faced beauties at Camelabad! <i>Now</i>
I can understand his contempt for our
taste, and the commiseration with which
he regarded us when we talked of beauty.”</p>

<p>“If anything does happen to him,
poor fellow,” said Captain Vaughan,
nodding towards the patient, “I suppose
it will be an awful blow to her; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
I must confess I can’t make head or tail
of his domestic affairs. You may be sure
there is something queer about her, or
he would never stay out here alone; and
he never alludes to his wife any more
than if she was dead. There is a screw
loose somewhere, believe me.”</p>

<p>“You saw her on board the trooper,
Vaughan; is she really as pretty as this?”
murmured Mr. Harvey, still wholly absorbed
in the photograph.</p>

<p>“<i>Much</i> prettier,” returned his companion
briefly. “Here! you can’t go
on staring at that all night! We must
set to work and write this letter; the
mails go down to-morrow morning. I
don’t half like the job, I can tell you;
and if anything <i>does</i> happen to Fairfax”—here
he winked away an unusual moisture
in his bold blue eyes—“I shall be frightfully
cut up myself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span></p>

<p>The two officers having at length put
their heads together, concocted the following
letter to Mr. Mayhew:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p>“It is with much regret that I
inform you of the very serious illness of
Sir Reginald Fairfax, and I have been
desired by the doctor in attendance to
prepare you for the gravest consequences.
Sir Reginald was wounded by some Ghazis
after the capture of a village, he having
had the foolhardiness to enter their house
alone, knowing it to be full of armed men.
He has a broken arm, and is only slowly
recovering from concussion of the brain,
caused by a blow on the back of his head;
and latterly he has had to contend with
a severe attack of malarious fever. I need
hardly mention that he has the best attention
of my brother-officers and myself,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
and everything that can be done for him
in such an out-of-the-way part of the world
has been most carefully carried out. We
can only hope and trust that his youth and
vigorous constitution may yet assert themselves
and shake off the fever now wasting
him away. I have been unable to find his
wife’s address; will you be so good as to
break the news to her or forward this
letter to her residence.</p>

<p class="right">
<span style="margin-right: 4em;">“Yours faithfully,</span><br>
“<span class="smcap">George Vaughan</span>.”<br>
</p>
</div>

<p>No sooner had the above been concluded,
closed, and stamped than the patient
suddenly woke up in his senses. After
languidly gazing at his friends for some
time, his eyes fell on his rifled desk and
his wife’s photograph. To his gesture of
amazement Captain Vaughan hurriedly
replied:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span></p>

<p>“Fairfax, my dear fellow, I know you
think we have been guilty of the greatest
liberty; but we had to ferret out your
friends’ address by the doctor’s orders.”</p>

<p>“Had you? Am I so bad as all <i>that</i>?”
he asked in a low tone. Receiving no
reply, he added, as if to himself: “I
suppose I am, I feel very weak and queer;
but I must write a line myself,” he said,
looking at Captain Vaughan gravely.</p>

<p>“Nonsense! It would be sheer madness.
I won’t allow it. One of us will write
at your dictation.”</p>

<p>“No, no! Impossible!” he answered
firmly. “Not to my wife. I must write
to her at any cost,” he continued, raising
himself feebly; and taking her photo in
his hand, he gazed at it long and
wistfully, then laid it down with a
sigh.</p>

<p>“Get me a draught of that fizzing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
mixture, please, and fix me up so that I
can write.”</p>

<p>Having carried his point, as usual, he
commenced, with great labour, to trace a
few lines, the beads of perspiration on his
forehead testifying to the effort they cost
him. Ere he had written twenty words
the pen dropped from his fingers, and
he fell back on the pillow completely
exhausted.</p>

<p>“I see it is no use,” he muttered to
himself. Then looking earnestly at Captain
Vaughan, he said: “You are going home;
go and see her. Take her my watch and
sword, they will do for the boy.” He
faltered, and his voice sank so low that his
friend could hardly catch his next almost
inaudible words; they were: “Tell her
I forgive her; tell her I loved her always;
tell——” Here his message came to an
end, for he had fainted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span></p>

<p>Great was the consternation of his
friends, the wrath of the hastily-summoned
doctor, the smothered indignation of
Cox.</p>

<p>The patient remained unconscious for
a considerable time, and when he came
to himself he fell into a deep sound sleep
which lasted for hours. The crisis was
past; next morning he was a shade better,
and from that day forward commenced a
slow but steady recovery.</p>

<p>In six weeks’ time, the regiment having
been ordered back to India in consequence
of the treaty of Gundamuk, he was invalided
home, sorely against his will.
Vainly he begged to be allowed to go to
Murree—to any hill station they liked;
to Australia even—for a six months’ tour.
But the doctors were firm—Dr. Bennett
especially so—home he must go.</p>

<p>“There is no place that will set you up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
like your native land,” quoth Dr. Bennett.
“That pretty young wife of yours had a
narrow escape of never seeing you again.
I’ve a good mind to drop her a line and
tell her what a headstrong patient she will
have to deal with.”</p>

<p>“I beg you will do nothing of the kind,”
returned Sir Reginald quickly, and with
visible irritation.</p>

<p>“Ah well! I have no doubt she has
her own way of managing you, and wants
no hints from me,” replied the doctor
facetiously, perfectly regardless of the signs
and signals that Captain Vaughan was
making to warn him off such delicate
ground. “She’ll never trust you back in
India, <i>I’m</i> certain.”</p>

<p>Whether he was to be trusted to return
or not was left an open question. One
thing was plain—he must leave India <i>now</i>.
He reached Bombay by easy stages, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
completely restored by the sea voyage,
landed at Southampton a month later, after
an absence from England of nearly three
years.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.<br><span class="small">MONKSWOOD.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Monkswood was the original family place
of the Fairfaxes. It was from Monkswood
that a Fairfax sallied forth, booted and
spurred, to ride with Prince Rupert; and
owing to having espoused that side, many
a fair acre was shorn away from him and
his descendants. Nothing, in fact, was left
to the next generation but the house and
demesne.</p>

<p>A succession of lucky speculations and
prudent marriages had restocked the
Fairfax purse, and Sir Reginald’s grand-father,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
instead of gambling and squandering
at Arthur’s, Crockford’s, Boodle’s, or
White’s, as was the fashion in his day—being,
on the contrary, of a thrifty turn of
mind—purchased Looton, which a card-playing
owner had brought to the hammer,
and it became the family seat. Still all
Fairfaxes were at least <i>buried</i> at Monkswood,
and during the season it was generally
visited for woodcock-shooting, for
which its thick woods were famous.</p>

<p>Monkswood was a good-sized red-brick
house, hideous and rambling and inconvenient
to the last degree. It was a
rare collection of architecture on a small
scale, as a room had been added here, a
window knocked out there, according to
the sweet will of the reigning Fairfax. It
was approached by a long drive, skirted on
one side by a thick laurel cover, and on
the other by a broad open demesne, dotted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
about with some splendid timber, oak and
copper beech in particular.</p>

<p>The house was entered by a shallow
flight of steps and heavy portico, leading
into a lofty oak-panelled hall, opening on
one side into the drawing-room and tea-room,
and on the other into the dining-room
and library.</p>

<p>The drawing-room side looked out on
a grand old-fashioned pleasure-ground;
the dining-room “gave”—oh horror!—on
the yard—a yard large enough for
a barrack square, with a long range of
loose-boxes and deserted stalls and coach-houses.
A couple of saddle-horses,
and Miss Saville’s fat ponies, Tweedle
Dum and Tweedle Dee, revelled at
least in plenty of room. Upstairs the
house was still more old-fashioned than
below; fireplaces in corners abounded;
cupboards broke out in the strangest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
places; and there were various passages
leading everywhere in general and nowhere
in particular, as you angrily discover when,
having followed one down to its source
as you flatter yourself, you open a fine
promising-looking door, and find a set of
empty shelves staring you in the face!
On the other hand, you are disagreeably
surprised when, on bursting open the door
of what you take to be a cupboard, you
find yourself precipitated headlong down
three steps into a large room. Huge four-post
beds and furniture to correspond
were <i>de rigueur</i>, and there was an old-world
feeling about the place altogether,
as if it had gone to sleep one hundred
years ago, and awoke, greatly surprised to
find itself in the present century. Everything
was antiquated, with the exception
of new carpets and curtains in the sitting-room,
a few fashionable chairs and tea-tables,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
Alice’s piano, and the furniture
of her bedroom, where a modern brass
construction relieved the time-honoured
four-poster, and a writing-table, wardrobe,
and lounge took the place of furniture
that would have been the <i>ne plus ultra</i>
of luxury in the reign of Queen
Elizabeth.</p>

<p>Need I here mention that the maiden
monarch slept a night at Monkswood?
According to the number of places which
boast of this honour, her majesty can
have rarely passed a night at home.</p>

<p>The house was overrun with old china,
and there were a good many family
portraits, simpering and scowling, about
the walls. The best—the beauties and the
handsome cavaliers—were all at Looton;
but frosty-faced old divines and plain
elderly matrons had been left undisturbed.
There was some Chippendale furniture too,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
and all kinds of queer old ornaments, odds
and ends, and even <i>clothes</i>, stowed away
carefully among the venerable wardrobes;
in fact, enough unappreciated <i>bric-à-brac</i>
to turn a collector’s head.</p>

<p>The pleasure-grounds opened through a
rustic gate into the plantations, which
skirted the whole demesne inside a high
wall. Through the plantations ran a walk
just wide enough for two. A dense growth
of underwood gave cover to thousands of
rabbits, and where the ground was visible
it was one mass of blue-bells and primroses
in the season.</p>

<p>Opening also out of the pleasure-grounds
was a large old-fashioned garden, chiefly
devoted to fruit and vegetables, though the
broad gravel walks that intersected it were
lined with wallflowers, carnations, lavender,
and hollyhocks. Its four gray walls did
not look down upon a “wealth of flowers,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
but they were covered with very excellent
fruit trees, and they overlooked the best
beds of asparagus within a radius of ten
miles.</p>

</div>


<p>Alice had found all prepared for her reception
at Monkswood. A moderate staff
of servants, culled from Looton, was awaiting
her arrival. They accorded her a
cold, not to say sullen, welcome; as they
unanimously blamed her, and her alone,
for their master’s sudden freak of shutting
up Looton and sailing for India. Their
attitude of dignified disapproval was entirely
thrown away on their young mistress,
who spent most of her time out of doors,
and quickly accustomed herself to a life<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
of complete solitude. In company with her
dog Tory, a fox-terrier, given her by her
husband before she was married, she
would spend hours roaming through the
garden and pleasure-grounds, and, above
all, the woods. They had a special attraction
for her—she liked their aromatic piny
smell, and they were leafless, deserted, and
dreary, and seemed exactly to match her
own frame of mind. Here, in utter solitude
and silence, only broken by the
snapping of a twig beneath her feet, the
flutter of a falling leaf, or the short sharp
barks of Tory in hot pursuit of a rabbit,
she could think without interruption.</p>

<p>To Tory these woods were Elysium itself,
and his most happy hunting-grounds.
Although always baffled by the agile bunny,
he returned to the chase each day with
renewed enthusiasm. As he sat, much out
of breath, on his haunches directly in front<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
of his mistress, seated on a log, his eyes
rolling, his tongue lolling, and his sides
palpitating, perhaps he wondered in his
own mind what could be the matter with
her. Why did those great round drops
roll down her cheeks and go splash on
her sealskin coat and small clasped hands?
Why did she take him up, and hug him,
and kiss him, and say: “Tory, no one in
all the world loves me as well as you do”?</p>

<p>Although Alice had spoken to Geoffrey
of her husband’s departure with easy indifference,
her indifference was assumed.
Her heart quailed when she thought of
India, sickness, and the field of action.
Each day, instead of deadening, only intensified
her grief. It will be seen that
her feelings towards her husband had undergone
a revulsion, and since she had been
out of the hearing of Miss Fane’s oracular
sayings, her opinion of his misdeeds had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
become greatly modified. If he was utterly
innocent, as in her secret heart she began
to believe, what was to be her fate? Twice
he had given her an opportunity to make
amends, and twice she had declined the
olive branch. She would never have another
chance, <i>that</i> was very certain.</p>

<p>As she looked down the dreary path
before her, strewn with fallen leaves and
branches, at the bare, gaunt, gray and
brown trees interlaced overhead, it was not
a cheerful prospect; and yet a far more
dismal vista presented itself to her mind’s
eye. A long, solitary, monotonous life at
Monkswood, where youth and beauty would
alike fade away unnoticed and unregretted;
her husband implacable, following with
ardour his beloved profession; her friends
indifferent and forgetful; what a miserable
existence seemed to be in store for her!
Could the haughty stern man, who had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
so bitterly upbraided her on Southsea Pier,
and bidden her such a cold and almost
contemptuous farewell, have been the bridegroom
who had sauntered by her side
through the deep green glades of the forest
of Fontainebleau? It seemed impossible.
What delightful mornings they had spent
among those old trees—she with her work,
he lying at her feet reading aloud Tennyson,
<i>Punch</i>, <i>Galignani</i>, whatever came
first; what rambles they had taken among
French farms and fields, exchanging tastes,
opinions, confidences; what delightful drives
and excursions they had made in the neighbourhood,
exploring the country in every
direction, losing their way, stopping to
dine at little out-of-the-way villages, and
meeting with numerous amusing adventures.</p>

<p>Then there had been that short trip
through Normandy, and home by the
Channel Islands; and what a welcome she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
had received at Looton!—rich and poor
testified their regard for its master by the
reception they gave his bride. How proud
he had seemed of her in those days, as,
dressed in one of Worth’s gowns, which
he had helped to choose in Paris, he led
her up to the Duchess of Dover, who was
giving a ball in their honour—the very last
she had been at. How she had enjoyed it too,
although Reginald never danced with her
<i>once</i>, telling her, when she remonstrated
with him as they went home in the
brougham, “That he did not approve of
bride and bridegroom dancing together, as
they had quite enough of each other’s
company, and might spare a few hours to
the claims of society;” and he had cut
short all her arguments with a kiss. She
remembered saying to him the day that
Geoffrey had been expected: “I suppose
we may consider our honeymoon over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
now?” “No,” he had replied, “I hope
ours will last as long as we live, and
that, no matter what happens, we shall
never love each other less than we do at
present. I can answer for myself, at any
rate,” he had said emphatically.</p>

<p>Rash promise! Three months of unutterable
happiness, and all was over! That
he <i>had</i> loved was certain. Never a very
demonstrative lover; yet a look, a word,
a caress from him were ten times more
precious from their rarity, and because
they bore the stamp of a tender, almost
reverent affection, than if another man
of more shallow feelings had overwhelmed
her with perpetual adoration.</p>

<p>Such thoughts as these, and such happy
recollections, only made the contrast between
past and present trebly painful. Day by
day, Alice became more miserably unhappy.
She spent her time aimlessly wandering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
about the woods or sitting indoors before
the fire, with Tory on her lap, talking
half to him and half to herself. Society
she had none: with the exception of the
clergyman’s family, the neighbours and
county held completely aloof, and left her
entirely to her own devices. They knew
that Sir Reginald had gone abroad, that
Looton was shut up. “There is something
very mysterious about the whole
thing,” they said, “and we will not be
in a hurry to call on Lady Fairfax.”</p>

<p>Consequently Lady Fairfax was left
entirely to herself.</p>

<p>At last Alice made up her mind to write
to her husband. She could no longer
believe in that false marriage certificate;
it was all a wicked lie from first to last.
Oh that she had thought so before! She
had determined to abase herself before him
and entreat his pardon. These feelings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
came to a climax one dim spring afternoon,
and, hastily glancing at the paper,
she saw that it was mail-day. She had
just half an hour before post time, and
so she hurriedly sat down and wrote a
short but truly penitent and loving letter
to Sir Reginald (the fate of which will
afterwards be disclosed).</p>

<p>“What a change in her life that single
sheet of foreign paper might make,” she
thought, as she kissed it and folded it, and
enclosed in it two or three violets taken
from a little bunch in front of her dress.
Ere the letter had gone out of the house
a load seemed lifted off her mind. In eight
weeks at most the answer would come back;
and the foolish girl sat down on the hearth-rug
and began to reckon up the days!</p>

<p>“He will come back himself,” she
whispered to Tory, as he laid his head on
her arm and blinked his eyes sagaciously.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
“And how glad we shall be to see him,
Tory, you and I! He will sit between us
here, at the fire, and he will scold me.
He will lecture me dreadfully, Tory, but
he is sure to be very pleased with you.
I will tell him what a good boy you have
been, and how you have kept me company.”</p>

<p>In vain she watched and waited for an
answer to her letter. Every morning, wet
or dry, accompanied by Tory, she walked
to the avenue-gates, and herself received
the post-bag. How she looked out for the
arrivals of the mails <i>viâ</i> Brindisi, and
reckoned up the days and hours till her
much-desired letter could come! When
the allotted two months had elapsed, and
it did not appear, hope, instead of being
silent, told a still more flattering tale.</p>

<p>“He is coming himself; he may be here
any day,” it said. For days, and even
weeks, Alice deluded herself with this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
idea. A step, the sudden opening of a
door, made her start and flush crimson.
But time went on, her boy was born, and
still no letter; so her heart hardened once
more. Not only was she herself slighted
and despised, but what outraged her
feelings in their most sensitive point, her
child was ignored. “He might have sent
me even one little line; he is barbarous,
cruel, unnatural,” were some of her bitter
reflections.</p>

<p>Miss Saville, a good-tempered, sensible,
elderly lady, very fond of her niece, had
come to Monkswood, and with her a new
<i>régime</i> commenced; no more untouched
meals, no more “moping,” as she called
it, permitted. But now that Alice had
her baby to engross her mind, she was not
so much inclined to live in the past as in
the present. When she did think of her
husband, it was with an indescribable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
mixture of remorse, indignation, and regret.
The “confessions” from Cheetapore were
duly forwarded to Alice, and were safely
locked up in her dressing-case; but as he
had not deigned to take any notice of her
abject apology before the matter had been
cleared up, it was unnecessary to trouble
him with another appeal, even supposing
her own pride would have permitted a
second abasement, which it would not.</p>

<p>When not occupied in the nursery, Alice
spent a good deal of time in taking long
rides in the neighbourhood. In company
with Martin, the old family groom, she
scoured the country for miles far and
near, very much to her own enjoyment and
greatly to the indignation of the surrounding
<i>élite</i>, who had no idea that a young woman
sent to Monkswood by her husband in the
deepest disgrace should be permitted so much
relaxation and amusement. Her horses were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
first-rate, her riding undeniable, and once in
the saddle she half forgot her troubles,
and seemed more like herself once more.
The perfect equanimity with which she
met the cold hard stare of the county
people, and the inimitable grace with
which she managed her thoroughbred,
made them feel—the ladies especially—more
wickedly disposed towards her than
ever.</p>

<p>The whisper of scandal was busy with
her name in a way that she, poor girl,
had little idea of; and stories were
circulated that would have made her
absent husband’s blood boil had he only
known. The accepted legend was, “that
she had been on the point of eloping with
her cousin, Mr. Saville, during her husband’s
temporary absence; that he had fortunately
returned just in time to frustrate their
plans, and, to save a public <i>ésclandre</i> and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
the Fairfax good name, had relegated his
erring wife to Monkswood, and had himself
volunteered for the East.”</p>

<p>“But she is all the same as a <i>divorcée</i>.
He has left her for ever,” her kind
neighbours whispered over their five-o’clock
tea; “and she is not to be
tolerated in Steepshire society.”</p>

<p>The Mayhews occasionally sent Sir
Reginald’s missives to his wife, and she
observed that, although her boy was
often alluded to with interest and affection,
her own name was never mentioned.
She had done violence to her pride in sending
him Maurice’s photograph, and he had
treated it with the same disdain as her
letter.</p>

<p>When the Afghan war broke out, all
his epistles to Mark or Helen were regularly
forwarded to her, and she received
the news of his having gained the Victoria<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
Cross with a pride that she did not attempt
to conceal; but her fears and anxieties far
outweighed any pleasure the intelligence
afforded her. It did not delight her to
hear that he had gained the <i>sobriquet</i> of
“Fighting Fairfax”—far from it; and when
Captain Vaughan’s letter arrived her agony
was beyond description. How she bore
the miserable week that intervened before
the next mail was only known to herself.
She endured in silence, opening her heart
to no one—taking no one into her confidence;
not shedding a single tear, but
going about her usual duties with a white
set face that fairly frightened her aunt.
“If he is dead,” she would say to herself
as she paced her room, “he has gone
without forgiving me. As I stand here he
may be already weeks in his lonely foreign
grave, and I, without knowing it, am his
<i>widow</i>. If this is the case, I believe it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
will kill me.” Never very robust at any
time, she looked now so worn, so thin, so
altered, even with the suspense of less
than a week, that it seemed as if it would
not take much to snap her hold on life.</p>

<p>She heard from the Mayhews of her
husband’s approaching return, and saw by
his letters how very reluctant he was to
come home.</p>

<p>He little knew that his wife’s eyes would
rest on the lines he was penning when he
said:</p>

<p>“I have no wish to return to England;
I am ten times happier out here than I
shall be at home; and excepting to see
you and Helen, and my son and heir, I
do not wish to set foot in my native land
for years. All my interests and all I care
about most are bound up in the fortunes
of the Seventeenth Royal Hussars. I
hope to get command of the regiment ere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
long, and if I do I would not change
places with any king or emperor you could
name.”</p>

<p>Alice read the above with apparent
composure and handed it back to
Helen, to whom she was paying a short
visit. Indignation and disappointment
were depicted in her face, in spite of her
heroic efforts to appear indifferent. She
went and stood at the window, to hide
the tears that would come into her eyes.</p>

<p>“He does not mean it, Alice,” said
Helen soothingly.</p>

<p>“It is nothing to me whether he does
or not,” replied Alice hotly, “but he does
mean it; at any rate we will not talk about
him.” Then continued, with womanly consistency:
“I can read between the lines of
that letter. <i>I</i> am the cause of his reluctance
to come home; he does not wish to
be in the same country with me; he hates<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
to remember that he is a married man; he
is afraid that we shall meet; but he need
not be. England is wide enough for both
of us, and I have no wish to see a husband
who has completely ignored me for nearly
three years.” So saying, and rapidly collecting
her hat, umbrella, and gloves (having
just come in from the park), she swept
indignantly out of the room.</p>

</div>


<p>Three years had made a wonderful change
in Alice: she was a very different Alice to
what she had been when we first saw her
at Malta. Her naturally high spirits and
elastic temperament had been almost totally
subdued and crushed by the life of retirement
and isolation she had led. She felt,
although barely twenty-one, as if she had
already lived her life: the happiness, gaiety,
and domestic sunshine, the common lot of
girls of her age, was not for her, an outcast
from society, a deserted wife. Sometimes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
her youth and natural buoyancy would
assert themselves, and she would find herself
singing and laughing as of old, especially
as she played with Maurice, and allowed him
to drive her as his willing steed up and
down the passages and round the garden;
but such were rare occasions.</p>

<p>The mistress of Monkswood was a tall,
slight, dignified young lady, who often
inspired her aunt with awe by the gravity
of her demeanour, and who found it hard to
realise that she and the madcap child of
former years were one and the same
individual. She utterly refused to leave
Monkswood, and, with the exception of a
flying visit to the Mayhews, had never
been away from home for one night.
Nor did she encourage people to stay
with her, saying she had no inducement
to offer, and that it was much too stupid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
at Monkswood to repay anyone the trouble
of coming so far.</p>

<p>At length her aunt, Miss Saville, greatly
concerned by her niece’s listlessness and
dejection, took upon herself to invite Miss
Ferrars, one of Alice’s former companions,
on a long visit. “The young,” she rightly
argued, “like the young; her former schoolfellow
will cheer her up. After all, an old
woman like myself is no companion for a
girl from one year’s end to another.”</p>

<p>Miss Ferrars duly arrived at Monkswood.
She was a year older than Lady Fairfax, a
clever, warm-hearted girl, with untiring
spirits and energy. She was tall and well
developed, and looked twice as much the
matron as her slim girlish hostess. She
had a pleasant, intelligent, rather than
handsome face, with sparkling brown eyes,
and quantities of beautiful bronze-coloured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
hair. She was unaffectedly surprised at the
change in her former schoolfellow. Could
this silent, grave, melancholy-looking young
lady be indeed the bright Alice of Rougemont,
who used to keep them all alive with
her bright face and gay sallies?</p>

<p>Soon they relapsed into their old groove,
however, going over their former experiences
with mutual pleasure. Professors, schoolfellows,
examinations, places, and people
were reviewed and discussed, and Alice
took her friend into her confidence on
every subject save one. Her Bluebeard’s
closet, her sealed book, was her husband’s
name, and <i>that</i> she always most scrupulously
avoided. To her friend’s inquiries about
him her answers were cold and brief; her
short married career she never touched upon,
and Mary Ferrars having indirectly heard
that Sir Reginald did not “get on” with
his wife, and was anything but a highly-domesticated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
animal, seeing that he had
been abroad for nearly three years, never
alluded to him again.</p>

<p>Miss Ferrars and Alice shared the same
room, and though they would lie awake
talking for hours in the most approved
young-lady fashion, nothing had escaped
Alice’s lips that gave her friend any clue
to the mystery which enshrouded her
husband. She roused herself for the entertainment
of her schoolfellow, and became
every day more like her old self. She purchased
a tame sedate steed for her use,
and gave her riding lessons, and together
they explored the neighbourhood. They
got up a lawn-tennis in the pleasure-grounds,
where they played half their
mornings, making Maurice very useful in
fetching the balls.</p>

<p>Maurice was now a young gentleman in
belted blouse, sturdy and well-made. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
had a fair broad forehead, dark eyes, dark
lashes, and dark curls. He already possessed
a very decided will of his own, and
was absolute master of all the womenkind on
the premises, from Alice to the cook inclusive.</p>

<p>The two young ladies had effected a
great change in the interior of the house.
The drawing-room was now a thing of
beauty and a joy for ever. They had
routed out old pictures and hung them on
the walls; the Chippendale furniture had
been brought to the front, and some beautiful
old china had been arranged on a venerable
black buffet that had been discovered
in the laundry; more plates and dishes
were affixed to the walls on velvet shields;
in fact, the drawing-room and tea-room
were their mutual hobby, and became two
of the most charming apartments possible
to see, with polished floors and Persian rugs.</p>

<p>June and July passed—a vision of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
hot, sweet-scented, languid summer days.
Then came August; and August brought
a visitor to Monkswood.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Meanwhile Sir Reginald had landed at
Southampton and made his way to London,
where he was rapturously received by the
inmates of Wessex Gardens. They thought
him graver, thinner, and very much sun-burnt
from the voyage, but otherwise he
was the same as ever. The day following
his arrival he produced presents for all the
Mayhew family—an Afghan matchlock
and knife for Mark; a Cashmere tea-set
and shawl for Helen; toys, puzzles, and
sweetmeats for the children.</p>

<p>Helen, having tried on her shawl and
viewed herself with much complacency in
all the mirrors and from every point of
view, came over to where Sir Reginald was
explaining a puzzle to the children, and,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
throwing herself into a chair opposite, said
abruptly:</p>

<p>“And what have you brought Alice?”</p>

<p>“Alice!” he stammered, reddening even
through the sunburn to the roots of his
crisp dark hair. Then immediately recovering
himself, replied, as he stooped to pick
up a piece of the puzzle which had fallen
on the floor: “Oh, nothing.”</p>

<p>“Has he not brought her <i>himself</i> and
his V.C.?” said Mark, giving him a tremendous
slap on the back. “What more
could she desire?”</p>

<p>“I am not so humble as to consider
myself <i>nothing</i>, whatever you may think
of me, Mark,” he returned, without raising
his eyes from the puzzle, which he had
just completed in the neatest manner; and,
holding it out on the palm of his hand,
he said: “Now, Hilda, if you put this
together before dinner this evening I’ll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
give you the biggest box of chocolate you
ever saw. I’m off to the club now,” he
added, standing up and preparing to depart,
cleverly eluding the fire of cross questions
with which Helen was preparing to attack
him.</p>

<p>For several days he evaded all her
attempts to inveigle him into a <i>tête-à-tête</i>;
his engagements were so numerous that he
was seldom at home, for all his old friends
flocked round him, and he was the
hero of the hour. Dozens of invitations
came daily pouring in, and he seemed to
be fairly launched in London society, and
carried away by its current. Helen, like
the hen whose duckling had taken to the
water, looked on in impotent despair.
The highest in the land, the beauties
of the season, were all equally ready
to engage his time. As she saw him in
the Row, the centre of a circle of former<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
brother-officers, then beckoned to the
carriage of one of the belles of the season,
who engaged him in most animated and
<i>empressé</i> conversation, she said to herself:
“This will never do; has he forgotten that
he has a home and a wife, or does he mean
to ignore both completely?” She sought in
vain for opportunities to sound him on
the subject; he never was with her alone.
All her little hints about Alice, all her
endeavours to bring her name into conversation,
were completely fruitless; he
exhibited a skill in avoiding this one
particular theme, a dexterity that irritated
and amazed her. At length, after he had
been nearly a fortnight in London, Helen
made up her mind to stand this state of
affairs no longer. Accordingly, the evening
when he was dining at the Guards’ Club,
she waited up for him in her boudoir.
Hearing him leisurely ascending the stairs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
between one and two o’clock, she went out
into the corridor and beckoned him into
her room, saying:</p>

<p>“Come in here, Regy; I want to speak
to you.”</p>

<p>Strangling a yawn, and laying down
his candlestick, he flung himself into the
nearest arm-chair with a mock tragic
gesture, and said: “Say on.”</p>

<p>It was all very well to say “Say on,”
but how was she to begin? Now that
she had caged her bird she began to realise
the delicate task that lay before her. She
well knew that it was a proverbially thankless
and dangerous mission to interfere
between husband and wife; and Regy,
although he had often stood a little boy
at her knee, and come to her with all
his grievances, was now a man, known to
be clever, distinguished, and thoroughly
able to think and act, not only for himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
but for others. How well he looked in
his mess-dress, so bronzed, soldierlike, and
handsomer than ever! He was leaning
back with his arms clasped behind his
head, regarding her with lazy amusement.</p>

<p>She must begin, she thought, <i>somehow</i>,
and forthwith broke the ice clumsily enough
by saying: “Had you a pleasant evening,
Regy?”</p>

<p>“A pleasant evening!” he echoed.
“Why, you foolish old lady, you never
mean to say that you have sat up till
nearly two o’clock to ask me such a
question?”</p>

<p>“No, not quite,” she replied, laughing
nervously. “The truth is, Regy—and
don’t think I am inhospitable, or want
to turn you out, or anything——” And
she paused.</p>

<p>“Well, and what is the truth, as you
call it?” he asked brusquely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span></p>

<p>“When are you going to Monkswood?”</p>

<p>“To Monkswood!” he repeated, suddenly
sitting erect and looking at her fixedly.
“That is easily answered——never!”</p>

<p>“Oh Reginald, you can’t mean it! Do
you not wish to see Alice or your
boy?”</p>

<p>“We will not speak of Alice, if you
please,” he said gravely. “I have nothing
to say to her; but you must manage that
I shall see the boy somehow, Helen,” he
added eagerly. “Could you get him up
here for a few days? I’m off to Norway
with Fordyce the end of the month.”</p>

<p>“I am quite <i>sure</i> that Alice would never
allow him out of her sight, and I will
never have him here without his mother.
Do you mean me to understand that you
will not suffer me to speak to you about
her?” she asked hotly.</p>

<p>“I do. Not even with you, Helen, my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
more than sister, will I discuss my wife—that
was.”</p>

<p>“Then,” exclaimed Helen with rising
indignation, “things are at a deadlock.
Alice will not speak of you to anyone,
you will not suffer me to mention her
name, and neither of you will have anything
to say to the other. I know I
could reconcile you both, were you not
so inconceivably proud and stiff-necked.”</p>

<p>“Look here, Helen,” he said, rising
and beginning to pace about the room,
“I know you mean well and kindly, but
take my advice and leave us alone. We
get on best apart. Our marriage was a
tremendous blunder; we both know that
<i>now</i>. I have endeavoured to forget that
I have ever had a wife. Alice and I are
utter <i>strangers</i>. As her guardian, I have
taken excellent care of her interests, and
studied her comfort and happiness as far<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
as it is in my power; but as her <i>husband</i>”
(and he emphasized the word), “I have
done with her.”</p>

<p>Hitherto he had been walking up and
down the room, but as he concluded he
came to a full stop before Mrs. Mayhew,
who, rising and stretching out her plump
white hands towards him with a gesture
of dismay, said:</p>

<p>“Are you mad, Reginald, to talk like
this? You do not know <i>what</i> you are
saying. It is very easy to repudiate your
wife to <i>me</i>; but when you do it publicly
what will people say? Have you thought
of that? What would you yourself say
of a young couple who married for love,
separated almost in their honeymoon, the
husband to go to India, the wife to shut
herself up in the country?”</p>

<p>“I would say nothing,” he interrupted.
“Why should I?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span></p>

<p>“Wait! I have not finished,” she
continued hastily. “The husband, after
an absence of three years, returns; comes
to London, mixes freely in society, but
never goes to see his young wife. You
must remember,” she pursued, literally
button-holing him by his mess-jacket,
“that you are Alice’s guardian as well
as her husband; she has no father or
mother, nor any relation in the world
to protect her good name except yourself
and Geoffrey, and he is only a
boy.”</p>

<p>“Geoffrey!” he exclaimed contemptuously.</p>

<p>“You don’t know what you are doing,
Regy,” she pleaded. “If you go abroad, as
you have arranged, without seeing Alice,
you will do her a great injury in the eyes
of the world. Your friends know that there
is an estrangement between you; at least<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
for the sake of appearances, patch up a
truce at any rate.”</p>

<p>“I am not a hypocrite, and I will do
nothing of the kind,” he muttered angrily,
drawing back and endeavouring to release
himself from his cousin’s grasp.</p>

<p>It was useless; she was a pertinacious
woman, and she <i>would</i> be heard.</p>

<p>“Do not go,” she entreated. “I never
see you alone now, and I must gain my
point—I must indeed. You <i>will</i> hear me.
It is all very well to say you have ceased
to think of Alice as your wife—which I
do not believe—but, at any rate, you cannot
forget that she is the mother of your child,
can you?” she asked, with an air and
emphasis that would not have disgraced
Mrs. Siddons.</p>

<p>No reply. “Silence gives consent, I
see,” she nodded triumphantly as she
continued; “and as the mother of your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
child, surely you would wish her to be
honoured and respected, if not for her own
sake at least for his?”</p>

<p>An impatient gesture of assent was all
his reply.</p>

<p>“Think of the life of retirement and
seclusion she has led; surely that has
been punishment enough?”</p>

<p>“Who is talking of punishment?” he
exclaimed, forcibly removing Helen’s hand.
“Alice is her own mistress, to come and go
as she pleases.”</p>

<p>“She has never left home nevertheless,
in spite of all our invitations, with the
exception of a short visit this spring. You
don’t know the <i>furore</i> she created; we used
to be quite mobbed walking in the Row.”</p>

<p>A very unamiable scowl was the only
notice he deigned to this remark.</p>

<p>“You have no idea how lovely she is,”
she urged impressively.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span></p>

<p>“Have I not?” he replied dryly.</p>

<p>“No; how can you?—you have not seen
her for ages. She is greatly changed in
every way; no longer the giddy, impulsive
girl you remember. If you only knew
how <i>distracted</i> she was when you were so
dangerously wounded!”</p>

<p>“Pray how can you tell?” he asked
with raised brows and a certain amount
of sarcastic incredulity in his expression.</p>

<p>“I know all about it from Miss Saville.
She told me that during the week that
followed Captain Vaughan’s letter Alice
fretted away to half her size, and that
her grief and misery were painful to
witness.”</p>

<p>Perceiving that he was gradually wavering,
she urged:</p>

<p>“You will <i>have</i> to go down to Monkswood,
my dear Regy, if only for the sake
of public opinion. Go as her guardian at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
any rate; putting your wife aside, it is
your duty to go and see your ward. You
will go, if only for a few days,” she
entreated anxiously.</p>

<p>“Yes, I will go,” he replied slowly and
with an evident effort. “I never looked at
the subject from your point of view before.
I see that it is necessary for me to study
appearances, but I only go as her <i>guardian</i>,
recollect. You are very eager in the
matter, Helen, and very pressing,” he
added with a smile, “but Alice is by no
means so anxious to see me as you
imagine.”</p>

<p>“She is! she is!” cried Helen, in whose
case the wish was father to the thought.
“And as for <i>you</i>,” laying her hand affectionately
on his shoulder, “you know you
are very fond of her all the time, and that
in your heart you are dying to see her;
now are you not?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span></p>

<p>“What would be the good of telling
you?” he replied evasively. “At any rate,
Alice does not care two straws about me.
I know her far better than you do, Helen,
wise as you think yourself. I know her
<i>private</i> opinion of me; but confidences
between married people are sacred,” he
added with a bitter smile. “I suppose
she knows that I have come home? he
asked abruptly after a short silence.</p>

<p>“Oh yes; I wrote and told her of your
safe arrival.”</p>

<p>“And what did she say?” he inquired
with unconcealed eagerness.</p>

<p>“Well, strange to say, Regy, she never
answered my letter. But then, you know,”
she added with an awkward laugh, “what a
very bad correspondent she is.”</p>

<p>“A very bad correspondent as you say,”
he replied, with such emphasis that Helen
looked at him amazed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span></p>

<p>“Tell me, Regy, has she never written to
you?” she inquired with solemn eyes.</p>

<p>“Then to-morrow or next day I shall
start for Monkswood,” he observed, coolly
ignoring her question.</p>

<p>“Do, my dear boy,” returned Helen
with effusion; “you don’t know how glad
I am to hear you say so. Mark and
Geoffrey and I will follow you the end of
the week and pay a visit to Alice, which
your arrival has somewhat postponed.”</p>

<p>“Well, now I suppose I may go to
bed?” said Reginald, taking up his candle
and looking at his cousin interrogatively.
“You have said your say, and carried
your point, have you not? I am not at
all sure that you are not sending me on a
fool’s errand, Helen.”</p>

<p>“I am very sure that I am <i>not</i>, Regy.
You will be grateful to me some day,
though now I daresay you think me a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
meddlesome, tiresome busybody. You
look awfully tired and fagged, so I won’t
keep you up any longer. Good-night!”
she concluded, holding up her cheek to
be kissed.</p>

<p>As the door closed on him, a triumphant
smile broke over her face. “<i>He</i> is all
right, at any rate. If Alice were as easily
managed or talked over all would be as
it ought to be in no time. I am only
sorry I did not make this opportunity
before,” said Mrs. Mayhew aloud, as she
turned to seek her well-earned repose,
firmly persuaded that she had achieved
a triumph of <i>finesse</i>.</p>

<p>Sir Reginald kept his promise, and
went down to Monkswood “solely in the
character of Alice’s guardian,” he kept
telling himself. “Perverse girl, <i>never</i>
would he own her as his wife, until she
had made complete submission,” and yet in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
his heart of hearts how ardently he longed
to see her! How he recurred again and
again to what Miss Saville had told
Helen! If they met alone, who could
tell but that she would encircle his neck
with her slim fair arms and whisper a
petition for forgiveness, for pardon—if
she only knew how readily, how eagerly
he would grant it!</p>

<p>The nearest station to Monkswood was
Manister, a cathedral and garrison town
five miles off. Here he procured a fly,
and with Cox and a portmanteau started
without delay. Arrived at Monkswood,
he told the driver to go round to the
yard and get refreshments for man and
beast, and desiring his servant to see
that his old room was got ready, he
sprang up the steps. The hall-door was
wide open, and he met Miss Saville
sallying forth in a large garden-hat, her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
hands protected by chamois-leather gauntlets
and her dress tucked up in a businesslike
manner. She was exceedingly
astonished, and beckoning her nephew-in-law
into the library, overwhelmed him
with questions. In reply to one of his,
she said that Alice was still far from
robust, or as gay and happy as she
could wish to see her, but that she was
wonderfully improved since Miss Ferrars
had been with her. “They were both
in the grounds, drinking tea under the
cedar; should she go and prepare
them?”</p>

<p>“No, certainly not; unless it would
give Alice a shock; and he supposed she
knew that he was in England?”</p>

<p>“Yes, she heard of your arrival some
days ago; but I think she scarcely expected
to see you here,” replied Miss
Saville.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span></p>

<p>“Did she not? And why not, may I
ask?”</p>

<p>“Do not inquire from me, Reginald;
you and Alice are the best judges of
your own affairs. I have never interfered
in any way, as you are aware.
Alice is the proper person to answer
your question. Naturally, she is deeply
hurt; I can see that. You have never
sent her one line since the birth of your
son; but I am not in her confidence.”
A footman, who had just entered, was
quietly motioned away during this conversation,
and went downstairs in great
excitement.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m blessed, Mrs. Morris, if
there isn’t a strange young man in the
library, and the old lady a-holding forth
to him like one o’clock, and he signs
me out of the room as cool as you
please!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span></p>

<p>“What is he like?” inquired a chorus
of maid-servants.</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s a tall dark swell, that looks
as if the whole place belonged to
him.”</p>

<p>“And so it does,” said Cox, his man,
coming in and banging down his dressing-case.
“If he is not master here, I’d like
to know who is?”</p>

<p>“Lor’, Mr. Cox, what a start you have
give us! And is it really Sir Reginald
himself?” cried Mrs. Morris, rising.</p>

<p>“You can use your eyes, Mrs. Morris;
there he goes down the steps.”</p>

<p>An immediate rush was made to the
window to catch a glimpse.</p>

<p>Yes, sure enough there he was, walking
towards the pleasure-grounds with Miss
Saville.</p>

<p>“Thank God, he looks well and strong!”
said Mrs. Morris with fervour, following<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
his retreating figure with tears in her
eyes.</p>

<p>“My! what a handsome gentleman!”
exclaimed an enthusiastic housemaid. “If
<i>he</i> does not suit her she <i>is</i> hard to please,
isn’t she, Polly?”</p>

<p>“Brown, please to remember yourself,”
said Mrs. Morris sharply.</p>

<p>“Not but that,” she added, relaxing,
“all the Fairfaxes are good-looking. Many
a time I carried him in my arms, the same
as I do Master Maurice. Ay, it seems but
the other day.”</p>

<p>“I little thought you would ever see him
again alive, ma’am; it was touch and go
with him once, I can tell you,” observed
Cox gravely.</p>

<p>“I must go now and see about dinner,”
seizing her keys and bustling about, “but
you will tell me all about it when you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
dine with me by-and-by, Mr. Cox,” said
Mrs. Morris, as, followed by the footman
and housemaid, she hurried from the
room.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.<br><span class="small">“MARY, IT IS MY HUSBAND!”</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Alice and Mary were to be found
under the cedars, a very favourite resort
of theirs those August evenings. A
round wicker table stood between them,
upon which were all the requirements
of afternoon tea. Alice, leaning back in
a low garden-chair, was reading to Mary,
who was knitting, “A Princess of Thule.”
How pretty she looked! The sun, glancing
through the sombre branches, fell in stray
flecks on her hair and dress—a white
cambric trimmed with quantities of lace<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
and knots of pale-blue ribbon. She was
twirling a carnation in her fingers as she
read. But there was a grave melancholy
expression in her downcast face, sad to
see in one so young. Coming to the end
of a chapter, she paused and exclaimed,
looking up:</p>

<p>“Well, I must confess, the Princess of
Thule ran away from her husband on
very small provocation. Don’t you think
so, Molly?”</p>

<p>Molly, instead of replying, said, as she
gazed intently over Alice’s head:</p>

<p>“Why, who is this young man coming
over here with Miss Saville?”</p>

<p>“Young man?” echoed Alice indifferently,
and without turning her head; “oh, it must
be the postmaster. Auntie promised him
a quantity of geranium and carnation
cuttings.”</p>

<p>“Does the postmaster wear well-cut<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
clothes and a dark moustache? Is the
postmaster a gentleman?”</p>

<p>“No, you ridiculous girl,” turning and
looking over her shoulder. After a minute’s
dead silence, “Mary,” she gasped, “it is
my husband!”</p>

<p>Her face was deadly pale as she raised
it to her friend’s, and letting the book slip
from her knees, she rose and leant against
the tree with both her hands pressed to her
heart. The cedar was between her and the
house, and she had time to recover herself
a little before her husband joined them.
As he approached she looked at him keenly.
Had he borne the traces of his recent
wounds and fever, and looked a war-worn
invalid, her woman’s heart would have
melted instantly, but as he came across
the grass his step was as buoyant, his eyes
as keen, and his bearing as gallant as ever.
A thousand thoughts seemed to crowd to her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
brain, her heart beat as though it would
choke her, she was trembling from head
to foot; as, with all the composure she
could muster, and without meeting his
glance, she gave him her hand in silence.</p>

<p>Miss Saville promptly introduced Mary
Ferrars.</p>

<p>“You and I ought to be friends, Miss
Ferrars; I was your brother’s fag at Eton,
and many a thrashing he gave me. Don’t
you think that that constitutes a tie
between us?”</p>

<p>He made the above speech in order to
give Alice time to compose herself; and
self-possessed as he seemed, his heart was
bounding wildly too.</p>

<p>“I hope you are now quite strong,
Alice,” he said, looking at her with evident
concern, for her face was as pale as ashes.</p>

<p>“Quite, thank you,” was her laconic
reply as she seated herself. Her knees<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
were trembling so that she dared not, and
could not, stand any longer.</p>

<p>“Give us some tea, my dear,” said Miss
Saville, who fortunately appeared to grasp
the situation, and tea was made; and as
it was handed about a certain amount of
conversation began to circulate. London,
and Reginald’s visit to the Mayhews, his
passage home, the latest news from the
East, formed in turn topics of discourse.
Alice scarcely opened her lips. Sir Reginald
might have been a casual visitor, who had
just dropped in, for all the warmth, sympathy,
or interest displayed by his wife.
A more uncomfortable quartette seldom
took tea together. No one would suppose
that the pale haughty-looking girl and the
dark bronzed young man, so leisurely sipping
his tea, were husband and wife, and
had only met within the last ten minutes
after a separation of years. Mary Ferrars<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
gazed from one to the other in silent
amazement. Although outwardly calm,
conflicting emotions were waging war in
their bosoms.</p>

<p><i>She</i> was thinking: “If I don’t manage
to get away I shall disgrace myself—I shall
burst out crying. This lump in my throat
will choke me.” <i>He</i> was thinking: “Helen
was dreaming. This notion of hers was
one of her most superb flights of imagination.
I was a fool to listen to her. She
was dreaming,” he repeated, as he looked
at his wife; and certainly in that pale set
face there was no sign of either welcome or
repentance.</p>

<p>These thoughts were interrupted by their
merry bold-faced boy, who, trotting past
Sir Reginald, far ahead of his grave and
stately nurse, rushed up to Alice, saying:
“I’ve come for cake.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, my darling!” replied his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
mother, stooping over his dark curls. “Presently.
Go over first and speak to that
gentleman, and give him a kiss.”</p>

<p>“Who is he, mother?” he asked, turning
round and gazing at Sir Reginald with the
facsimile of his own eyes—in fact the
child’s face was such a striking reproduction
of his own that he himself could not help
seeing the likeness. He was a splendid
boy, of whom his father, were he a king,
might well be proud.</p>

<p>Leaning his upright little person against
Alice, and throwing back his head with a
proud gesture very entertaining in one so
young, he repeated, as he looked at Sir
Reginald unflinchingly:</p>

<p>“Who is he?”</p>

<p>“He is your father,” she faltered. “Go
and speak to him, Maurice.”</p>

<p>She could not refrain a glance of motherly
pride as she pushed her boy with gentle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
force towards his other parent. But
Maurice, who had inherited all his father’s
deliberation and decision of character,
calmly remarked:</p>

<p>“<i>He</i> is not my father. My father,” with
much pride, and hands stuck in the belt
of his blouse, “is a soldier, and rides a
horse with a long tail, and wears a sword
and a red coat, and fights people. <i>You</i>,”
said he, nodding his head towards Sir
Reginald, “are just like anybody else.”</p>

<p>“Come here, sir,” said his father, stretching
out an arm; and, much to everyone’s
amazement, the boy went quietly over and
stood at his knee.</p>

<p>“I am a soldier; but I have got a
holiday. You don’t know what that is
yet, do you? I have done with soldiers
for awhile, and have put away my sword
and my coat; but I’ll show them to you
some day, if you like.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span></p>

<p>“Will you?” said the child with awe-struck
eyes; “and will you lend me your
sword to play with, for I’m going to be
a soldier too some day?”</p>

<p>“Are you indeed? I’m afraid I can’t
lend you <i>my</i> sword; but perhaps I might
buy you a little one instead. Suppose you
come and sit on my knee and tell me all
about yourself?”</p>

<p>So Master Maurice, nothing loath,
climbed up; and Alice, with a beating
heart, saw her child in her husband’s arms
for the first time. The two faces were so
alike, and yet so different; she could now
compare together, if she dared; but she
shrank from meeting her husband’s eyes.</p>

<p>Maurice was completely fascinated by
the strange gentleman, and regarded him
with mingled curiosity and delight.</p>

<p>“Are you my father?” he asked incredulously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span></p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And why did you not come to see me
before?”</p>

<p>Here was an embarrassing question.</p>

<p>“Because I have been in India,” was
the evasive reply.</p>

<p>“And are you come to stay at home
now?” Momentary pause. Without waiting
for a reply he pursued: “I’ve seen
your picture often. Alice keeps it in a
locket; that one,” pointing a firm brown
finger at his unfortunate mother, and
raising a scorching blush to her hitherto
pale face. “She says I am to love you
very much—as much as her.”</p>

<p>“Do you love her?” continued this pitiless
innocent; “do you love Alice?”</p>

<p>Reginald, painfully embarrassed, cast
about for a reply. In desperation he
answered:</p>

<p>“Of whom are you speaking, Maurice?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
It is not possible that you call your mother
Alice!”</p>

<p>“Yes, sometimes; and so do Aunt Mary
and Miss Ferrars.”</p>

<p>“Well, you are not to do it any more,
remember. Now tell me your name?”
said his father, catechising in his turn.</p>

<p>“Maurice Reg—nald Fairfax.”</p>

<p>So he had not been wholly forgotten.</p>

<p>“And how old are you?”</p>

<p>“Past two, long time. How old are
you?”</p>

<p>“Past twenty this long time. Are you
a good boy, do you think?”</p>

<p>“Alice knows,” he replied, nodding with
easy confidence towards his mother.</p>

<p>“Yes, Alice knows,” said she, rising
quickly and stretching out her hand;
“Alice knows that it’s your bedtime, so
say ‘Good-night’ and come along.”</p>

<p>“No! no! no! not yet!” he cried,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
clinging tightly to Sir Reginald and
burrowing under his arm.</p>

<p>“Maurice, listen to me,” said his father
gravely, setting him down. “You told me
just now that you intended to be a soldier,
did you not?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” returned Maurice eagerly.</p>

<p>“Well, you will never do for a soldier
if you go on like this; his first duty is
obedience. Now give me a kiss, and go
with your mother at once.”</p>

<p>Maurice, whose <i>forte</i> was certainly not
obedience, raised his eyes and looked at
his father. Seeing that he was perfectly
in earnest, he climbed once more on his
knee, imprinted an experimental kiss on his
moustache, and reluctantly departed with
many regretful backward glances, Reginald
watching the retreating pair till they were
out of sight. Were they really his wife
and son? He could scarcely realise it;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
for, after all, he had had a very few months
of married life and twenty-seven years of
bachelor liberty. He felt much more like
a bachelor than a Benedict.</p>

<p>Miss Saville, following his eyes, said:
“You may well look proud of him. Is
he not a splendid boy? But he wants a
father’s hand over him sadly. Alice is his
slave, and has been so ever since he was
born. She gives up to him in every way,
and he treats her more as his playfellow—as
you may see—than his mother.”</p>

<p>Alice, having deposited Maurice in the
nursery, ran quickly down to her own
room, to be alone for a little time to think
and to compose herself.</p>

<p>She leant her hot forehead against the
frame of the open window and gave way to
a feeling of utter and undivided joy—joy
that he was home, alive, and well, and under
the very same roof as herself—at least<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
within earshot. She paused as she heard
Mary’s gay musical laugh. They were all
walking about the grounds; she could see
them. He was standing on the gravel
path, telling them something very amusing
evidently, for as he concluded Miss Saville
and Miss Ferrars both laughed immoderately.
With this laugh came a revulsion
of feeling. “<i>He</i> could joke; he could
be exceedingly entertaining. This meeting
was nothing to him. He had not shown
the smallest signs of emotion or agitation.
He had merely come to see if she was
sufficiently meek and humble to be reinstated
in his good graces. No, she was
<i>not</i>,” she said to herself, as she thought
over the utter neglect with which he had
treated her for the last three years. “He
thinks he has only to extend the top of
his sceptre and I shall be only too thankful
to approach. But he is mistaken; I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
shall be ‘<i>Vashti</i>’ to the end of the
chapter. I shall never humble myself
again. Pleased as he is with Maurice now,
he has never taken any direct notice of
him all these years.”</p>

<p>Alice dressed rapidly, hardening her
heart with bitter recollections at every
moment. Just as she had completed her
toilette, and was arranging some flowers in
her dress, the door opened and Mary
hurried in.</p>

<p>“Oh you sly girl!” she exclaimed;
“dressed already? I thought you were
doing something of this kind to ensure a
nice long <i>tête-à-tête</i> with <i>him</i>. Oh Alice!”
she cried, taking her in her arms and kissing
her warmly, “what a happy young
woman you are! How very, very glad I
am for your sake! Why did you never
tell me your husband was so perfectly
charming—so handsome, so distinguished-looking?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
How proud you must be of him,
my dear!” holding Alice at arm’s length
and looking at her with eager interrogation.</p>

<p>Alice, whose hair and costume were
slightly disordered by her friend’s enthusiastic
hugging, drew back rather flushed
and out of countenance.</p>

<p>“Mary,” she said, averting her face as
she rearranged the roses in her dress,
“you are very good, and mean very
kindly, but”—and she paused—“but I
must tell you something I never meant
to tell you. Reginald and I do not get
on very well together. We—we—do not
suit; but do not take any notice, <i>please</i>,”
she entreated as she looked at her friend
appealingly. “You will soon see”—and
she stopped; then continued: “Reginald
is my guardian, you know; and he and
I thought the best thing to do was to
marry. But he is far more devoted to his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
profession than to me. His sword is his
real wife, and I—I—get on very well
alone, as you have seen, and will see.”</p>

<p>“What shall I see?” asked Mary. “I
see that you are the handsomest couple I
have ever come across, and I have no
doubt you are equally well matched in
other respects.”</p>

<p>“Well, <i>qui vivra verra</i>,” replied Alice, as
she opened the door and disappeared,
anxious to avoid her friend’s inquiries.
Reginald, having hurried his toilette,
hastened down to the drawing-room in the
hopes of seeing Alice for at least a few
minutes alone. Her greeting had been
cold and constrained; but she was taken
by surprise. She was agitated, and his
lovely shy Alice was the last to offer or
accept caresses in public. It would be
different when they met alone.</p>

<p>He stood for some time in the deep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
window, looking out into the park. How
still and green and cool it all looked after
the bustle and heat and glare in India!
“There was no place like home after all,”
he thought as his eyes roved over the undulating
sward and the clumps of splendid
timber, and he watched the rooks soaring
nestwards and heard the corncrake’s discordant
yet familiar “Craik-craik.” The
door, which was ajar, was at this instant
pushed open, and with a swish of long
trailing skirts Alice advanced into the
room. At first she seemed to hesitate,
but on second thoughts approached the
window.</p>

<p>“What a lovely evening it is, is it not?”
she remarked, unfurling an enormous black
fan with a grace all her own.</p>

<p>“Lovely indeed!” replied her husband,
turning his back to the landscape and
scanning her critically.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span></p>

<p>After a pause of thirty seconds (employed
by his wife in steeling herself with
recollections of the past), “Alice,” he asked
with a gesture of appeal, “have you
<i>nothing</i> to say to me?”</p>

<p>“To say to you?” she repeated, with
raised brows and an air of most perfect
indifference. “No, nothing particular; unless
that I am afraid you had a very warm
journey here to-day. Early in the afternoon
it was absolutely broiling.”</p>

<p>“Well, yes, it <i>was</i> warm—a good deal
warmer than the welcome you gave me.
But you can make up for that <i>now</i>,” coming
closer. “Alice, are you not going to say
you are glad to see me?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am very glad to see you,” retreating
two steps and making a shield of
her fan.</p>

<p>“And is that all?”</p>

<p>“I think so—what more do you expect?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
You are nothing but my guardian,” she
replied, avoiding his eyes.</p>

<p>“<i>Indeed!</i>” with an imperceptible start.</p>

<p>“Yes. You made the arrangement <i>yourself</i>;
do not blame <i>me</i> for holding you to
it,” she answered hurriedly.</p>

<p>“That arrangement, as you call it, was
made under utterly different circumstances,
when you did not, and would not, believe
that I was your lawful husband. It is
different now—you know better than
that.”</p>

<p>“It may suit you to change <i>your mind</i>,
but I do not alter mine. You are my
guardian, and nothing more; as husband
and wife we are strangers.”</p>

<p>“Is this your matured determination?”
said Sir Reginald in a transport of indignation.</p>

<p>“It is,” she replied firmly. “You have
forgotten the existence of your wife for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
the last three years: continue to forget
her. Do you think I have no pride?”</p>

<p>“Pride—<i>no</i>!” he exclaimed angrily. “I
could not dignify it by such a name. You
are consumed by a senseless besotted obstinacy,
that no doubt you are pleased to
consider as such.”</p>

<p>“You are, as usual, most flattering,”
replied Alice, carelessly fanning herself,
considerably but inwardly agitated.</p>

<p>“I will take you at your word,” said
Sir Reginald in a low but steady voice.
“I shall consider your decision <i>final</i>—as
husband and wife we are strangers.
But I had hoped——” and he paused.</p>

<p>“What did you hope?” she asked
sharply.</p>

<p>“Never mind; it is of no consequence
<i>now</i>,” preparing to withdraw from the
window.</p>

<p>“Tell me,” she asked, detaining him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
with a movement of her fan, “did you
ever get the photograph of Maurice that
I sent you?”</p>

<p>“I did,” he replied in an icy tone.</p>

<p>“You did!” she echoed. “You really
did!”</p>

<p>“I did, as I have before remarked,
and what then?” looking at her sternly.</p>

<p>“Only that you must have also——”
Here her answer was cut short by the
entrance of Miss Saville and Mary; and
Sir Reginald, walking to the other end
of the room, remained aloof, looking out
of the window till dinner was announced.
During this short interval he had time
to recover his composure and to collect
his thoughts, and there was no trace of
anger or agitation in his countenance as
he took his seat at the foot of the dinner-table.
No one could guess the enormous
effort it had cost him to attain such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
self-command. How strange it looked to
see Alice and her husband sitting opposite
each other—host and hostess—master and
mistress! A man’s voice was an agreeable
acquisition to the three trebles, not
that one of them was much heard. Sir
Reginald had that clear high-bred speech
which is so expressively authoritative and
yet so musical; he spoke like a man
who meant what he said. As to Alice,
indifferent and uninterested as she looked,
each syllable of those dear familiar tones
thrilled her to the heart! Not once during
dinner did he directly address her—he did
not even look at her so far as she knew.</p>

<p>“He is very, very angry with me,”
she mused as she made a feint of eating.
“But it was better to let him know at
once that I am <i>not</i> ‘the patient Griselda!’
When he cools down he will respect me
all the more for respecting myself! No<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
doubt I was too hasty, abrupt, and perhaps
aggressive. I might have softened it
more—but then I never can! I have no
tact!” Absorbed in her own reflections,
she never observed the signals Miss
Saville was making to her; her eyes
were steadily fixed on her plate, and
her thoughts apparently miles away.</p>

<p>“My dear, do you not think that we
had better go into the drawing-room?”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, auntie,” she exclaimed
with a start. “Of course.”</p>

<p>Sir Reginald accompanied the ladies,
and spent a considerable time in looking
over photographs and talking to Miss
Saville, Alice having betaken herself to
a distant arm-chair and Mary to the
piano. After she had played for some
time, she went over to Alice, and in an
audible whisper said, as she stooped to
arrange a tumbled chair-back:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span></p>

<p>“Come now, it is your turn; come
and sing those two new songs you got
last week.”</p>

<p>“No, not to-night, Molly,” she replied,
shaking her head very decidedly. “Do
not ask me, I could not sing a note!”</p>

<p>In the same way when Miss Saville
challenged her to their usual game of
backgammon, as at night the old lady’s
eyes were too weak for working or
reading.</p>

<p>“Not to-night, please, auntie,” she said
plaintively, “I really feel too stupid.”</p>

<p>“If you will accept me instead, Miss
Saville, I will play with pleasure; but I am
afraid you will find me a most contemptible
foe,” remarked Sir Reginald, as he
arranged the board all wrong.</p>

<p>The old lady accepted his offer with the
greatest alacrity, and they commenced to
play without further delay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span></p>

<p>Mary felt actually <i>ashamed</i> of Alice, who,
at some distance from her relatives, lay
back in her chair composedly knitting,
pausing now and then to count the stitches,
and then resuming her occupation as if her
bread depended on it.</p>

<p>“Was this the way to welcome a husband?
No wonder they did not ‘get on’ if
Alice conducted herself in this fashion.”</p>

<p>As to her husband, as far as Mary could
judge, there was nothing outwardly amiss
with his manners or appearance. She took
the opportunity of studying him whilst he
was busily puzzling his brains over the
backgammon board.</p>

<p>About his good looks there could be but
one opinion; but did not a certain curve
of the nostrils speak of pride? Was not
firmness almost too weak a word to convey
the expression of his mouth and chin?
Would not a man with less patrician beauty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
and a more yielding disposition be better
calculated to make a woman happy?</p>

<p>As she thought all this with a contemplative
gaze, she suddenly found a pair of
dark eyes fixed on herself with evident
interest and amusement.</p>

<p>“Am I so fortunate as to remind you of
anyone, Miss Ferrars?”</p>

<p>“No,” she replied hastily. “Please excuse
my rudeness, I had no idea that I
was staring so hard; but you must remember
that you are actually the first
Victoria Cross I have ever seen; and
pardon me.”</p>

<p>“Surely you did not expect to see anything
unusual in my appearance on that
account?” he asked with a smile. “I
daresay you have seen many as deserving of
the distinction, if not more so. It is all a
matter of luck.”</p>

<p>“Is that the way you speak of your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
honours?” said Miss Saville, pouncing
down remorselessly on a blot. “I have
no doubt you are very proud of the cross
all the same, and that you earned it <i>well</i>,”
she added with conviction.</p>

<p>A bald desultory conversation was kept up
and solely supported between Miss Saville
and her nephew. Even Mary, from her
opulent resources, could find but little to
say, for Alice’s demeanour paralysed all
efforts at sociability. Alice, leaning back in
her chair with an air of serene divine beatitude,
enacted the part of a blanket of the
heaviest and wettest description.</p>

<p>A very dreary evening at last came to an
end, and when the ladies had departed
Reginald strolled out into the pleasure-grounds
to have a smoke and a think.</p>

<p>As he paced moodily up and down, his
reflections were anything but agreeable—very
much the reverse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span></p>

<p>“What an infernal idiot I was to have
come here! Fairfax, thy name is <i>fool</i>,” he
added with bitter emphasis. “Far from
being inclined for <i>peace</i>, Alice does all she
can to <i>pose</i> as the injured wife. There is
nothing like taking high ground,” he muttered
to himself, contemptuously kicking
a fir-cone out of his way. “When the
Mayhews come I’ll go, and meanwhile I’ll
meet Alice on her own terms. I shall take
her at her word once for all. No more
halting between two opinions; no womanish
caprice; we shall be strangers. I am
actually talking to myself,” he exclaimed
with a shrug of his shoulders; “an infallible
sign that my reason is beginning to totter.
Well, if the worst comes to the worst, I
shan’t be the first Fairfax that has been
an out-and-out <i>fool</i>.”</p>

</div>


<p>Being an early riser, Sir Reginald took
a walk with his son and improved their
acquaintance before breakfast the following
morning. They found their way to the
stables by mutual consent. Sir Reginald
was astounded at their empty condition.</p>

<p>“Where are the carriage-horses?—where
are the brown cobs?” he asked
authoritatively.</p>

<p>“Please, sir, Lady Fairfax sent them
back to Looton more than two years ago,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
as she never used them. She never drives,”
said the groom gloomily.</p>

<p>“Then what are these two hunters doing
here?”</p>

<p>“Her ladyship rides ’em reg’lar!”</p>

<p>“Rides them! Do you mean to say
that she rides that chestnut, ‘Cardigan’—the
most ungovernable brute I ever
owned? There must have been some great
mistake in their coming here at all. These
are not the horses I ordered to be sent
down.”</p>

<p>“I allus thought so, Sir Reginald; but
her ladyship would not hear of any change,
and I must say she do manage that mad
cracked beast uncommon. But he is no
ways fit for a lady, nor indeed for a
gentleman.”</p>

<p>“Well, see that you never saddle him
for her again. Those are my orders,”
he said, turning away. “She must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
have thought that I wanted to break her
neck. Ignorance has certainly been bliss
in my case. Many a wretched hour I
would have spent had I known that Alice
had adopted Cardigan as her park hack,”
he muttered to himself as he walked
towards the house in answer to the gong
which summoned him to breakfast.</p>

<p>The same afternoon the Mayhews and
Geoffrey arrived. After five-o’clock tea
under the cedar, and a turn round the
garden with Reginald, Helen was escorted
to her room by her hostess.</p>

<p>“Shut the door and come here, Alice; I
want to speak to you,” she said imperatively.</p>

<p>Alice, knowing from the tone of her
voice that a lecture was coming, took a
seat in the deep window-sill, and clasping
her hands round her knees, looked up
at her mentor with grave expectant
eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span></p>

<p>“There is <i>no</i> use in your looking at
me with the air of a Christian martyr,
you tiresome girl. What is this amazing
piece of folly that I hear from Reginald?”</p>

<p>“I am sure I don’t know,” replied
Alice innocently.</p>

<p>“He tells me that you received him as
an utter stranger!”</p>

<p>“Of course I did.”</p>

<p>“I assure you, Alice, most solemnly,”
said her friend, brandishing her hairbrush
to give emphasis to her words, “that his
patience is well-nigh exhausted, and you
have bitterly, sorely disappointed him. Your
power over him is rapidly waning, and
no wonder. He told me in plain English
that he would trouble himself no longer
about you. He came home softened towards
you by illness, time, and absence, and,
little as you deserved it, laid his laurels<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
at your feet. From all accounts you flung
them in his face! What a foolish reckless
girl you are! Your happiness comes to you,
and you spurn it. ‘Too late, too late!’
will be the answer when you yourself go
to seek it ere long.”</p>

<p>“But listen to me for one second, Helen,”
interrupted Alice, vainly endeavouring to
stem the torrent of her friend’s eloquence.
“Hear me for an instant. I never expected
him to come here; he took me utterly
by surprise. Would you have had me
volunteer an embrace—after our chilly
parting, after three years’ absolute silence?
I <i>did</i> humble myself to the very dust
before him, and all in vain.”</p>

<p>“When? How? You are talking nonsense!”
exclaimed Helen excitedly. “Nonsense
I fail to understand.”</p>

<p>“Promise me, my dear Helen, that you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
will <i>never</i> breathe it to mortal, not even
to Mark,” she whispered.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, I promise,” returned her cousin
with almost tragic solemnity.</p>

<p>“It was before Maurice was born. He
never took any notice. I blush when I
think of it,” she continued, burying her
face in her hands. “I sent him Maurice’s
photo too,” she murmured.</p>

<p>“Well!” with a gasp of amazement,
“I cannot understand it. But you must
remember that you treated him horribly.
Do not despair of his forgiveness yet. I
am sure that in your heart you love him
dearly. Make one effort to win him back
for yourself. I know how hard it is to
conquer one’s pride, but surely the happiness
of your whole life is worth a little
humility, just as much as the throne of
France was worth a mass.” Laying her
hands on Alice’s shoulders, and looking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
down at her gravely, she said: “If
Reginald leaves this to-morrow evening
in his present state of mind, you will never
see him again as long as you live! that
is my firm belief.”</p>

<p>“Oh Helen! do you really mean it?”
she faltered.</p>

<p>“Yes, of course I do. He will go out
into the world and mix in society, where
he will be made much of; petted by women,
for whom a hero <i>has</i> attractions. Basking
in the world’s smiles, rich, handsome, and
successful, he will soon forget the proud,
heartless, obstinate girl he once called wife.
All sympathy will be for him. For you,
living here in remote seclusion, eating your
heart out with unavailing regrets, what
will you do? You will not even have
the comfort of your own compassion; all
you can say will be, ‘It serves me right!’
And as year by year snatches a portion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
of your youth and beauty from you, you
will settle down into a miserable, dejected,
hopeless woman.”</p>

<p>“My goodness, Helen, what a horoscope!
what a picture!”</p>

<p>“Then, Alice, unless you would see it
a reality, be up and doing; rouse yourself,
endeavour to be the gay lighthearted
Alice of former days. Instead of
cold looks and short answers, try once
more smiles and jests, assume a virtue if
you have it not; get out some of your
former perfect wardrobe and make yourself
as lovely as you can, and I promise you
you will find yourself much happier ere
long. You <i>will</i> make an effort to make
friends, will you not, my dear girl?” said
Helen, smoothing Alice’s shining hair
and kissing her on the forehead. “As a
wife, it is your <i>duty</i> to be submissive.”</p>

<p>“It is a very painful, difficult duty,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
said Alice, laying her face against Helen’s
arm.</p>

<p>“Do you wish to lose him altogether,
Alice?” exclaimed Helen impatiently.</p>

<p>“No, no, I could not, I will not,”
she whispered without raising her head.
During the last few moments Alice’s love
and pride had struggled in mortal conflict,
and pride had been slain. After a silence
of nearly five minutes, she raised her head
and stood up, and turning her tear-stained
colourless face to her cousin said:</p>

<p>“What shall I do if Reginald repulses
me, as he most probably will, since you
say he is so angry?”</p>

<p>“Never mind; after all he is your husband,
in spite of the folly you both talk about
ward and guardian. He is as much your
husband as Mark is mine, and you need not
be bashful in making stray little advances
to him. It is not as if you were a stranger.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span></p>

<p>“It will be just as bad as if he were. I
told him we were to be strangers for the
future.”</p>

<p>“You told him <i>that</i>!” exclaimed Helen
with a gesture of incredulity. “I never
heard of such madness—never! Impress
upon him without delay that you have
exercised your sex’s privilege and changed
your mind. Run away now and get ready
for dinner; the first bell was rung ten
minutes ago. And let me see that you
will be a good sensible girl for once, and,
what is more important still, a good wife.
Remember that we have always to give
in.”</p>

<p>“If you only had any idea of the task
you have set me, and how small and miserable
I feel,” replied Alice, with her hand on
the door-handle.</p>

<p>“Come, be off. Don’t talk nonsense.
You have no time to lose. Don’t let me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
see that face at dinner—you look as if
Melancholy had marked you for her own.
Away with you,” cried Mrs. Mayhew,
playfully pushing her out of the room.</p>

<p>Parker was amazed to hear her lady
say:</p>

<p>“Get me out my white silk and gauze
dinner-dress, please, as quickly as possible,
and run down to the pleasure-grounds,
and bring me a bunch of crimson
roses.”</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later Alice appeared in
the drawing-room, where she was the
cynosure of all eyes except her husband’s;
he merely swept her face with one cold
glance, and resumed his conversation with
Geoffrey.</p>

<p>She wore a long and exquisitely-made
square-cut white silk, with a bunch of red
roses in her bosom. A piece of black velvet
was fastened at her throat by a diamond<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
star, with solitaires in her ears to correspond.
Dinner went off much more cheerfully
than on the previous day. Alice and
Geoffrey seemed to have forgotten their
feud and fallen into their old ways; their
gay repartees and small jokes provoked
general amusement. Alice caught her husband’s
eyes fixed on her more than once in
grave, puzzled amazement.</p>

<p>In the drawing-room, Alice went unasked
to the piano and sang two songs, “Rest
on your battle-fields, ye brave,” and “The
Rhine Maiden.” She sang the former with
such intense pathos and feeling that Mrs.
Mayhew and Mary were on the very verge
of tears. Her pure, deliciously sympathetic
voice called forth pleasure on every face
except the one on which she wished to see
it reflected.</p>

<p>Her husband continued his occupation of
pulling Tory’s ears as unconcernedly as if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
there was not a note of music within ten
miles. After a time a round game was
proposed.</p>

<p>“Come along, Alice,” said Geoffrey, “and
help me to count the markers,” emptying,
as he spoke, a basketful of mother-o’-pearl
fish on the crimson cloth. As she stood
beside the table in the full light of the
lamp, busily reckoning dozens of counters,
her husband realised how lovely she was—lovelier
than ever, as Helen had said. What
could surpass the exquisite symmetry of
her slender figure, her delicately-chiselled
profile, or the graceful poise of her haughty
little head? What her face had lost in its
perpetual ripple of smiles it had more than
gained in expression. She had grown, too,
he discovered, at least an inch; her head
was far above Geoffrey’s shoulder. How
young and girlish she looked, not more
than nineteen at the outside! <i>Who</i> would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
believe that she was the mother of that
great boy upstairs? It seemed absurd.
How well he knew her half-foreign tricks
and gesticulations with her pretty taper
hands, as she indignantly accused Geoffrey
of purloining a dozen counters more than
his share. Would anyone think, as they
looked at her standing there, that she was
utterly without heart, as cold and callous
as a block of marble, a miracle of obstinacy,
and unreasonable beyond belief?</p>

<p>Presently she approached him, outwardly
with graceful composure, inwardly with
much trepidation, and said, without raising
her eyes above his enamel solitaire shirt-stud:</p>

<p>“You will play, will you not, Reginald?”</p>

<p>“Thanks, no,” he replied, leaning still
farther back in his chair and languidly
drawing Tory towards him by both ears.</p>

<p>“Oh do,” she persisted, nervously twisting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
her bangles round and round her
wrist; “we are so few, and Geoffrey says
you can teach us a new game.”</p>

<p>“No, thank you, Alice, I feel too stupid
this evening.”</p>

<p>This speech was evidently said with
intention, and a look that baffled and
chilled her accompanied the shaft as it
went home.</p>

<p>“Nonsense, my good fellow!” exclaimed
Geoffrey from the card-table, “of course
you’ll play. I never heard of such laziness.
You will have to come to make up the
number.”</p>

<p>Thus adjured, he was obliged to join
the circle, where he ostentatiously selected
the farthest seat from Alice. All the
same he sat opposite her, and was
forced during the game to address her
frequently; but his tone was coolly formal,
and frozen indifference was in his glance.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
Nevertheless, it was as much as he could do
to keep his head cool, with those lovely
wistful eyes opposite him. “What, in
Heaven’s name, does she mean?” he
muttered to himself over his cards, as
more than once she made some remark
and smiled at him across the table.</p>

<p>“<i>Souvent femme varie, folle qui se fie.</i>
She has perhaps changed her mind in spite
of her assurance to me yesterday. I shall
not change <i>mine</i>, come what may.”</p>

<p>His answers to her questions were curtly
polite, and he appeared totally absorbed
in the game, and nothing but the game,
and the enormous heap of counters that
were piled before him.</p>

<p>“Just look at Reginald,” said Geoffrey,
pointing enviously at his riches; “did you
ever see such luck? What’s that saying
about love and play? Something beginning,
‘<i>Malheureux en jeu</i>——’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span></p>

<p>“Never mind French quotations,” interrupted
Helen precipitately, and frowning
and signing at Geoffrey, “but pay me
the six counters you owe me.”</p>

<p>“What are you nodding your head and
frowning for?” inquired this exasperating
youth. “I’ve not said anything, have I?”
looking round with an air of injured
innocence.</p>

<p>“I’m bankrupt!” exclaimed Alice, suddenly
folding her hands on the table and
looking with a mock-melancholy face at
Mark.</p>

<p>A reckless gambler, she had just seen
her last counter swept away, and was
utterly penniless. Loans were freely offered
by Helen and Geoffrey.</p>

<p>Helen was only too glad to divert the
conversation, but much to their astonishment
she declined their assistance, saying,
as she held a pink palm across the table:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
“Reginald is the richest of you all; he
has made a fortune, and he is the proper
person to pay my gambling debts.”</p>

<p>With a look of unqualified amazement
he divided his heap of counters into two
portions, and without a single remark
pushed one of them towards Alice. In
doing so she observed for the first time
a deep scar across his wrist.</p>

<p>“What is that dreadful cut, Reginald?”
she asked timidly.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” he replied shortly, pulling
down his shirt-cuff and rapidly dealing out
the cards.</p>

<p>“One of his many honourable scars,”
explained Geoffrey. “It’s an uncommonly
deep sabre cut he got that time he took
the standard, and only——”</p>

<p>“Never mind standards and scratches,
but go on with the game,” interrupted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
Reginald with a tinge of asperity in his
tone; “it’s you to lead, Geoffrey.”</p>

<p>“I say, Rex,” returned Geoffrey, as if
struck by a happy thought as he leisurely
sorted his hand, “wouldn’t it be fun if
you were to give a lecture, a <i>public</i> lecture,
on the Afghan war, say in the Assembly
Room at Manister? It would fill like mad,
and you might send the proceeds——”</p>

<p>“To an asylum for idiots,” interrupted
Sir Reginald impatiently. “Will you play
or not, Geoffrey?”</p>

<p>“I’ll play, of course!” returned that
youth tranquilly, “but why should we not
temper cards with conversation? Here”—nodding
towards Alice—“I play the Queen
of Hearts!”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>After breakfast the next morning, the
ladies of the party sauntered about the
garden and grounds. An easy-chair, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
cigar, and <i>The Times</i> supplied the Honorable
Mark’s requirements. Sir Reginald,
declining Geoffrey’s challenge to a game of
tennis, repaired to the library to write
letters.</p>

<p>Alice having done the honours of the
garden and shown Helen the most reliable
fruit trees, ran back to the house for a
basket, in order to gather some plums
for dessert. In returning, she nearly came
into collision with her husband at the
garden-gate. Very much to her surprise
he accosted her, saying:</p>

<p>“Alice, the carriage-horses and cobs will
be here this evening. I beg that you will
not send them away again.”</p>

<p>“But they are of no use to me, really.
Auntie has her ponies, and I never
drive.”</p>

<p>“But for the use of your visitors, and
returning calls, a carriage is indispensable.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span></p>

<p>“I never have any visitors, nor have
I any calls to return.”</p>

<p>“Pray why not?”</p>

<p>“No one has called on me. Is not that
an excellent excuse?”</p>

<p>“Am I to understand that you have
no acquaintances?”</p>

<p>“With the exception of the clergyman’s
family and the Ruffords, who
live at the other end of the county, and
the Grantleys, who are abroad—I may say,
none.”</p>

<p>“Is this by your own wish?”</p>

<p>“Well, no; not that I care two straws
for society, but I will not conceal from
you”—with a faint smile and drawing a
pattern on the gravel with her pretty little
shoe—“that I am <i>not</i> a social success.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean me to understand that
you are what is called ‘not visited’?”</p>

<p>“If you look at it in that light, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
suppose I am <i>not</i>,” she replied, glancing
towards the garden-gate, and moving a
few steps in its direction.</p>

<p>“Will you permit me to inquire the
reason?” he asked, following her and
interposing himself between her and the
garden.</p>

<p>“I would rather not tell you,” she
answered in a low voice, picking off the
blossoms of syringa that embowered the
gate, and putting them into her basket.</p>

<p>“But you will have to tell me,” he
exclaimed, leaning his back against the
gate and setting his straw hat with its
zingari ribbon still farther over his eyes.</p>

<p>“I cannot,” she faltered, blushing furiously.
“There is no good in telling you;
it will only make you—I mean,” correcting
herself, “it may annoy you.”</p>

<p>“Annoy me!” he echoed; “I am quite
accustomed to that. Pray don’t study me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
in the matter; I am used to being <i>annoyed</i>,
as you call it. Come, do not trifle with
me any longer—tell me at once why you
are not visited in the neighbourhood.”</p>

<p>“I told you before I could not,” looking
down the gravel path that lay between
them and the house, and evidently preparing
for an abrupt departure.</p>

<p>“You shall not go!” he exclaimed,
seizing her by the wrist, as if he had
divined her intention. “Neither shall you
pass through this gate till you answer my
question,” putting his shoulder against it
and looking the very picture of resolution.</p>

<p>“Why do you tease me like this,
Reginald? Do not detain me. Please do
not ask me to answer your question,” she
urged, endeavouring to withdraw her
hand.</p>

<p>“You must, and you <i>shall</i> tell me,” he
said angrily, involuntarily squeezing her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
wrist still tighter. “Neither you nor I
shall stir until I know. As your guardian
it is my duty to inquire into the reason
that you are excluded from society.”</p>

<p>“Only as my guardian—not as my
husband?” she asked in a low voice.</p>

<p>“Certainly—only as your guardian. You
gave your husband a lesson lately that he
is not likely to forget. Never allude to
him again, if you please.”</p>

<p>“But I did not mean—at least I am
sorry—I was hasty,” she stammered.</p>

<p>“Your sorrow comes too late—your
sincerity is doubtful. Pray excuse my
rudeness, but remember that it is to your
guardian <i>only</i> you are speaking,” letting
go her hand at last.</p>

<p>“Then, as my guardian, I don’t mind
telling you,” turning away her face, and
becoming perfectly scarlet as far as the ear
and cheek that were visible were concerned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span></p>

<p>“They think—they say——”</p>

<p>“Go on,” he urged inexorably.</p>

<p>“That I am a <i>divorcée</i>. There!” she
cried, facing him, “the murder is out!”</p>

<p>“What!” he exclaimed in a voice that,
although not loud, made her start. “You
dare,” he said slowly, “to repeat such a
tale to me?”</p>

<p>“I had no choice; you <i>would</i> hear it.
There is no use in being angry with <i>me</i>; it
is not my fault. You know very well that
I do not deserve such a stigma—that every
thought in my heart belongs to Maurice,
and,” she added almost under her breath—“<i>you</i>.”</p>

<p>His sharp ears caught the last word.</p>

<p>“That <i>is</i> putting it strongly indeed.
Nothing could be more forcible,” he replied
with a sneer. “So they say you are a
<i>divorcée</i>?” he continued, his passion repressed
but at a white heat all the same,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
looking her over from head to foot.
“Where are the grounds for this most
infernal scandal that ever was hatched by
evil-tongued old women? What is the
story?” he asked vehemently.</p>

<p>“I do not know,” replied Alice, now
perfectly composed. “Of course I would
be the <i>last</i> to hear.”</p>

<p>“It does not appear to concern you
much,” he exclaimed angrily.</p>

<p>“No, not <i>much</i>,” she replied, looking at
him with her clear, frank, truthful eyes.</p>

<p>“By Jove, then it concerns <i>me</i>! Society
about here wants a lesson in good manners
and hospitality if in nothing else. If I can
find out the originator of this outrageous
calumny it will be worse for him. I believe,
if he was here now, I would——But
never mind, what is the good of blustering
about it to you? I shall <i>act</i>, that is more to
the purpose. How can you be thought a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
<i>divorcée</i> when you were never divorced?
The story is senseless; you imagine it,
perhaps.”</p>

<p>“It is not imagination that no one ever
calls here, is it?” she asked dryly. “I
believe it is thought that you sent me to
Monkswood to hush up scandal and to save
the Fairfax name, and that I am really as
bad as ever I can be.”</p>

<p>“As bad as ever you can be!” he repeated,
with remarkable fluctuations of
countenance, and half under his breath.
“As bad as ever you can be!” he repeated,
his eyes alight with a sombre fire.</p>

<p>“I do not see that you need be so <i>very</i>
angry, Reginald. Remember that it is my
<i>guardian</i>,” emphasizing the word; “it does
not concern you so much.”</p>

<p>“It does concern me. Nothing could
concern me more,” he answered vehemently.</p>

<p>“If I had known you would have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
so fearfully angry I never would have told
you. How unreasonable and inconsistent
you are. You insisted on an answer; you
made me speak by main force”—holding up
her slender wrist, which still retained the
red mark of his fingers—“and when your
wish is gratified you are furious. You are
encroaching on the privileges of my sex;
now are you not?” she asked with a
smile.</p>

<p>“Did <i>I</i> do that, Alice?” he exclaimed
aghast, pointing to her wrist. “I most
sincerely beg your pardon. I was so determined
to hear the truth that I forgot it
was not a man’s arm I was grasping. I
have been downright brutal, but the idea
of anyone casting a slur on <i>you</i> of all
people drives me beside myself. I am
afraid I have been very rude and violent
altogether; but you are acquainted with
my temper of old, and time, as you may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
observe, has not improved it,” he concluded
with a short laugh.</p>

<p>“May I look at your wrist?” he asked
with real concern depicted in his face.</p>

<p>“You may,” she replied, frankly placing
her thin little hand in his.</p>

<p>“I hope you will forgive me, Alice. I
must have hurt you,” he added after a
pause, dropping her hand with a respectful
distant gesture, as if he had suddenly
recollected himself.</p>

<p>“You did hurt me. You have no idea
how strong you are; your hand feels as if
it were made of steel. ‘I’ll forgive you
<i>this</i> time,’ as Madame Daverne used to say,
‘but don’t let it occur again,’” she added
with an assumed gaiety she was far from
feeling.</p>

<p>After a silence of some minutes he said:</p>

<p>“I can promise you one thing, Alice, and
that is, that you shall resume your proper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
position in society, and be treated with
the respect to which you have every claim.
Your good name and mine are one. We
will not talk any more on the subject, and
I need not detain you longer,” opening the
garden-gate politely and standing aside to
allow her to pass. But Alice was apparently
in no hurry; she continued pulling the
syringa mechanically.</p>

<p>“I want you to promise me something else,
Reginald. Will you be friends with me,”
she asked, raising her sweet wet eyes to his.</p>

<p>“Friends!” he echoed, fairly staggered by
the question. “Friends!” he reiterated in
a slow deliberate tone, “of course. As
your guardian, I must be your friend; and
I am,” he replied stiffly.</p>

<p>“That is not the sort of friend I mean.
A guardian seems to me to be a sort of
stern surly old gentleman, who doles out
money, and orders one about, and keeps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
one in order, and is altogether horribly
disagreeable.”</p>

<p>“Charming picture! May I ask if I am
the original?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“No, of course not; you may be stern
and disagreeable, but you are not old and
surly.”</p>

<p>“You are really <i>too</i> flattering!”</p>

<p>“If you knew how few friends I have,
how alone in the world I feel, you would
not say <i>no</i>,” she urged.</p>

<p>“Did I say no?” he inquired with raised
brows.</p>

<p>“You certainly have not met my
advances halfway,” she replied with a
forced laugh. “You <i>will</i> be my friend,
will you not, Regy?” she pleaded, laying
her hand timidly on his coat-sleeve.</p>

<p>“I thought we were to be strangers?”
he returned, coolly and politely removing
her fingers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span></p>

<p>With a gesture of impatience Alice
turned away, struggling hard to repress
her tears, and with a fair assumption of
dignity endeavoured to open the gate
which a moment before had closed itself
with a bang. She could hardly see as
she bungled at the bolt.</p>

<p>“Allow me!” said her husband, starting
forward to her assistance. To her unutterable
dismay and disgust, one of her
too ready tears fell with a splash on his
slim brown hand. It had the effect of
melting him at once. He gazed at Alice
steadfastly, and with a softer look in his
dark eyes than they had known for many
a day.</p>

<p>“You foolish girl! if you really think
my friendship worth having—do you not
know very well that it is yours, and that,
in spite of everything, I am always your
best friend? How can I be otherwise?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
Much and often as I have wished it, I am
not one of those who can forget.”</p>

<p>“Nor are you one of those who can
forgive!”</p>

<p>“How can you tell?”</p>

<p>“How can you ask me such a question?”</p>

<p>“Well, we won’t argue about it. You
say you want a friend?”</p>

<p>“I often want a friend to advise me—someone
older, wiser, and better than I
am.”</p>

<p>“I can hardly flatter myself that you
allude to me,” he said, surveying his wife
with the gravest astonishment.</p>

<p>“Yes, of course I do.”</p>

<p>“To obtain your good opinion has
always been my ambition; but I had no
idea that I held such a high place in
your esteem. You have quite taken my
breath away.”</p>

<p>“I wish you would not talk in this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
horribly satirical manner; it is not at all
nice of you, Reginald—not a bit like what
you used to be! What has changed you?”</p>

<p>“I am not the least like what I used
to be; in many respects I was a fool,” he
replied with perfect equanimity.</p>

<p>“Were you, really?” she said, stopping
and looking at him with wide-open eyes.
“What makes you say so? You are
joking.”</p>

<p>“All right! let us imagine that I am
joking. You say you want a friend ready
with counsel and advice. What more can
you desire than Helen?” waving his hand
towards the garden. “If you are fond
of taking advice—of which ‘I hae me
doots,’ as the Scotchman said—there is
no one who loves imparting it better.
It will be a mutual satisfaction for both
parties.”</p>

<p>“Now you are down on Helen’s little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
weakness; that’s rather a shame, you know.
Of course I have Helen for a friend and
adviser, but——”</p>

<p>“Excuse me for interrupting you, but
may I light a cigar? It has the same effect
on me that music is popularly supposed to
have on the savage.”</p>

<p>“Go on, Alice,” he said, when he had
lit up to his satisfaction; “you were
telling me something very interesting just
now about a friend. Why will not Helen
meet all the requirements of the case?”
he asked, with a mocking expression in his
eyes.</p>

<p>“Do be serious.”</p>

<p>“Very well, I will,” he answered with
sudden gravity. “You say you want an
intimate, confidential, particular friend, and
have done me the honour to offer me the
post.”</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span></p>

<p>“I beg to decline it in the most unqualified
manner. I am your friend in
the best sense of the word—I would cut
off my right arm to serve you—but a friend
at a distance, one that you will seldom hear
of, much less see. The friendship of which
you have visions is out of the question
between us, and only possible between
husband and wife. Be satisfied with your
own arrangements; we are ward and
guardian, nothing more. Do not be vexed
with me for speaking plainly; you asked
me to be serious, and I am serious. It
seems to me that you do not know your
own mind two consecutive hours, but I am
not so changeable. You had everything in
your hands the other day; it was a question
of now or never. Two words would
have bridged the gulf between us; you
did not speak those two words, and now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
the occasion for them will never occur again—you
let slip your last opportunity.”</p>

<p>“I do not in the least understand you,”
she faltered.</p>

<p>“If you reflect for a moment, I think
you will remember the two words—the
key to the riddle.—Here comes Geoffrey,”
he observed, as Geoffrey, in a cool gray
suit, with a flower in his button-hole, came
bounding towards them.</p>

<p>“Well, upon my word,” he exclaimed,
“I’ve been watching you two for the last
twenty minutes, talking away nineteen to
the dozen, and had I not previously known
I should have declared it one of the most
promising flirtations I ever interrupted.”</p>

<p>“You are always thinking of flirtations,”
said Alice, hastily turning away. “Come
along, and help me to gather some plums;
Helen is waiting for the basket.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.<br><span class="small">“SIR REGINALD’S EYES ARE OPENED.”</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“Alice, I have such a crow to pick with
you!” exclaimed Mrs. Mayhew, bursting into
her room the same afternoon, as she was
dressing for lawn-tennis.</p>

<p>“With me?” pausing with one arm in
the sleeve of her dress. “Pick away, I
daresay I shall find a bag to put the
feathers in.”</p>

<p>“It is no joking matter, I assure you,”
said Helen, leaning one hand on the
dressing-table and nodding her head with
much solemnity. “Reginald has been so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
angry with me, I declare I feel just as I
used to do after I had had a lecture from
papa. I never saw him in such a rage in
my life, and all about you,” she concluded
indignantly.</p>

<p>“<i>Cela va sans dire</i>,” replied Alice, coolly
selecting a handkerchief from her sachet.</p>

<p>“What is this monstrous tale you have
been telling him about not being visited,
and being tabooed as a <i>divorcée</i>? I never
heard of anything so utterly absurd. I told
him that it was entirely a delusion; that
living so much alone had made you fancy
and imagine things; and that I was certain
it was all a mistake—mere imagination.”</p>

<p>“You should not have said that, Helen,”
replied Alice gravely. “Is it imagination
that, although I have lived here for three
years, not one in the neighbourhood has
crossed the threshold with the exception
of the rector and the Ruffords? Am I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
taxing my imagination very heavily when
I say that I am never asked to join in any
of the local charities, bazaars, or concerts,
although belonging to one of the oldest
families in the county, and known to be
abundantly blessed with riches? Am I
drawing on my imagination when I tell
you that the looks which I meet are too
disdainful to describe?—that were I that
dreadful woman I heard you telling auntie
about, who had run away from her husband
and children—gone off with an
actor I think you said—they could not hold
me in greater scorn and contempt?”</p>

<p>“And why has this never come to my
ears? Why have you kept it from me
all along? Reginald has been telling me
that he left you under my charge and
Mark’s, and a pretty way I have fulfilled
my trust, he says, when he comes home,
only to find you outlawed from society.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
Why was I not told? Was this fair
to me, Alice?” said Mrs. Mayhew, sinking
into a seat with an air of being entirely
overwhelmed.</p>

<p>“We kept it from you on purpose, auntie
and I; we thought there was no use in
worrying you and Mark, and all you could
have said or done would not have been
of the slightest use. All the waters in the
sea would not have washed me white in
the estimation of my charitable neighbours.
When first I came here I was too miserable
to notice anything; then for a long time
I was very ill, as you know. It was fully
a year before I became really alive to my
position, as you would call it. Then auntie
spoke to the rector, and he told her the
truth—that it was said that Reginald had
separated from me for very good reasons;
and he asked her point-blank if we were
on friendly terms. What could she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
say?”—with a gesture of appeal—“she
told him the truth—that we were not,
but that our difference was entirely a matter
between ourselves, and did not concern the
world at large. But, unfortunately for us,
the world at large is deeply interested in
our affairs. The rector believed auntie, I
am sure, but no one else will listen to such
an explanation for one second; and as it
transpired through the servants and the
post-office that I never received any Indian
letters, but lots of English ones in a man’s
hand—Geoffrey’s—my fate was sealed. I
am considered a dreadful young person.
Tell me, Helen,” putting on a most
bewitching little hat, and looking at her
mischievously with her head on one side,
“do I <i>look</i> very improper?”</p>

<p>“Alice, how can you go on like this?”
exclaimed her cousin hysterically. “How
can you jest on such a subject? What an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
odd extraordinary girl you are; at one
moment in the wildest spirits, at another
in the depths of woe.”</p>

<p>“You cannot accuse me of very wild
spirits lately, at any rate, and you must
not forget that I have Irish blood in my
veins, and excuse my vagaries on that
score. I can tell you that I surprise <i>myself</i>
very much at times.”</p>

<p>“Alice! Alice!” shouted Geoffrey from
downstairs.</p>

<p>“There, I must be off. Do not look so
dismal, my dear horrified Helen. Now that
Reginald has come here, people will think
better of me, you will see. Come along,”
she continued, taking her arm and hurrying
her down the corridor, and flying with her
downstairs at a breakneck pace, “they are
all waiting for us on the tennis-ground;
even Mark is going to play.”</p>

<p>“If you had not been so perverse,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
shutting yourself up, refusing to come to
us in London, and living the life of a
nun, these dreadful ideas would never
have occurred to people,” panted Mrs.
Mayhew breathlessly. “It was your own
fault entirely, your <i>own</i> fault,” she concluded
emphatically, as they came within
earshot of Geoffrey, who was waiting for
them at the edge of the lawn.</p>

<p>The Monkswood people played tennis all
the afternoon with great zeal and spirit: Alice
and Mary, Reginald and Geoffrey, all clad in
orthodox white flannel apparel, had had
some capital games; Mr. and Mrs. Mayhew,
less young and active, having settled
down after the first half hour into the <i>rôle</i>
of spectators, under the shade of a wide-spreading
horse-chestnut, where claret-cup
and tea awaited the thirsty. At length,
breathless and hot, Reginald and Geoffrey,
who had been playing a match, came over,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
and, throwing themselves at full length on
the grass, said: “For goodness’ sake, give
us something to drink! Send round the
claret-cup!”</p>

<p>“So you were beaten, Geoffrey? <i>Poor</i>
Geoffrey,” observed Alice compassionately,
as she handed him a bumper of claret and
soda-water.</p>

<p>“I haven’t half a fair chance with him,”
he replied with a deprecating nod towards
his victor; “he has a tremendous pull
over me—he is such an A 1 racket-player;
spent hours in the racket-court every day in
India.”</p>

<p>“No, no, merely to keep myself from
going to sleep of an afternoon. I’m only a
very moderate player, indeed,” expostulated
Reginald modestly.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you will say that you are a
very moderate cricketer too?” said Geoffrey,
with an air of calm judicial severity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span></p>

<p>“Nothing to boast about, certainly.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll do the boasting for you; and
that reminds me that I met the curate in
the village this morning.”</p>

<p>“No very novel or startling sight.
<i>Après?</i>”</p>

<p>“He is coming up here this afternoon
to ask you to play in the local cricket-match
on Monday, also to wait on you
and pay you the visit of ceremony.”</p>

<p>Reginald, who had been reposing at full
length, gazing up speculatively among the
wide broad-leaved branches, now turned
suddenly on his elbow and brought himself
<i>vis-à-vis</i> to Geoffrey with a stare of profound
incredulity in his handsome dark
eyes.</p>

<p>“The Phœnix Club against the world!
The curate is a cricket-maniac of the first
water. He has let me in for it—I’m a
Phœnix,” concluded Geoffrey in an aggrieved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
tone. “I only trust we shall have an
appreciative audience next Monday.”</p>

<p>“I hope you impressed upon the curate
that there was not the smallest probability
of my taking part in the match,” said
Reginald imperiously.</p>

<p>“<i>Au contraire</i>; on the principle of the fox
who has lost his tail, I informed him that
you were well known at Lord’s and elsewhere
as one of the best bowlers in the
Service, and that he had only to enlist
you among the eleven to ensure a signal
victory; consequently he will take <i>no</i>
refusal.”</p>

<p>“But I do not intend to play,” remarked
Reginald firmly. “You forget that I have a
stiff arm. My cricketing days are over;
for the future, as far as the noble game
is concerned, I intend to live on my
reputation.”</p>

<p>“Your arm is as well as ever,” returned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
Geoffrey with calm conviction; “I would be
very sorry to stand a buffet from it. <i>That</i>
excuse shan’t serve you—and, by the same
token, here’s the holy man coming up the
avenue in a carriage and pair.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, Geoffrey!” exclaimed Mrs.
Mayhew, looking over her shoulder.
“Alice”—in a tragic tone, and with a
significant glance—“here are visitors.”</p>

<p>“So I see,” replied Alice with wonderful
nonchalance. “I suppose I must go in,
though, literally speaking, I am <i>out</i>. Who
will go with me?” looking round. “Don’t
all speak at once.”</p>

<p>“Not I, for one,” returned Mary
promptly; “if I accompanied you with
this red face”—fanning herself with a small
branch of horse-chestnut leaves—“the
people would think you had been beating
me. Besides, I see too much of that old
lady in her yellow bonnet as it is; she sits<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
just in front of us in church. I believe she
is the greatest gossip in the county, so be
sure you don’t commit yourself beyond the
weather, and the beauty and amiability
of a certain Miss Ferrars who is staying
with you.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go with you, my pretty Alice,” said
Geoffrey, still, however, retaining his recumbent
position, and making believe to
play the guitar upon his tennis-bat, and
fingering away with great fluency and
skill.</p>

<p>“‘Nobody asked you, sir, she said,’”
quoted Alice, standing up and shaking some
crumbs from her lap. “Your manners are not
sufficiently formed—you don’t know the
meaning of the word ‘decorum,’ and you
always try to make me laugh or inveigle me
into some horrid blunder, and then you are
delighted and sit grinning like a Cheshire
cat. No, <i>you</i> won’t do.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span></p>

<p>“Thanks, fair cousin, thanks,” raising
himself to a kneeling posture, and making
a profound full-length salaam on the short
green sward.</p>

<p>“I see I must go alone,” exclaimed Alice,
glancing hopelessly at her husband, who
was lying on the grass, smoking, his
arms folded behind his head, his hat over
his eyes, the very embodiment of luxurious
lazy indifference.</p>

<p>“Don’t drink <i>all</i> the tea, good people,”
was her parting injunction as she hurried
off across the lawn, the whole party following
with admiring eyes her well-poised
figure and graceful gait.</p>

<p>“I must go in too,” said Helen with
visible reluctance, when she had conscientiously
drained her second cup of tea. “I
promised to drive down to the village with
Miss Saville. She thinks one of the schoolmaster’s
daughters would be an ideal maid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
for Hilda. Heigho! I suppose I must leave
you,” rising heavily.</p>

<p>“It is to be hoped that this ‘ideal maid’
will turn out to be something more beautiful
than your present treasure, Helen,”
remarked Geoffrey impressively. “To say
that she is plain about the head but feebly
expresses it; if you were to set her up in
a field, not a crow would come near it.
Shall I come with you”—half rising—“and
give you the benefit of my critical
and artistic eye? I’m not half a bad
judge,” he added complacently.</p>

<p>“How can you be so detestably vulgar!
Fancy discussing the appearance of people’s
servants,” said Helen, with the air of
lofty righteous indignation.</p>

<p>“And why not?” pursued Geoffrey
serenely.</p>

<p>“Why not?” echoed Mrs. Mayhew.
“Well, for one thing——However, I’m<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
not going to bandy words with you now—here
are all these people coming from the
house, and I must flee,” she added hastily,
as she turned and hurried off among the
trees in the hopes of making her escape
unseen.</p>

<p>She was quite correct—Alice was actually
sallying forth, escorting two elderly ladies
and a vapid-looking youth, with hay-coloured
hair and an incipient ditto moustache.
He wore an extraordinarily high
collar, an eye-glass, and pale lavender
gloves, and it was easy to see that he
considered James Blundell, Esq., the very
glass of fashion and the mould of form.
He was sucking the knob of his cane with
greedy relish, and casting every now and
then glances of marked approbation on his
pretty young hostess, as he stalked along
beside her.</p>

<p>“What in the world possessed Alice to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
bring them out here?” growled Mr. Mayhew
irritably, as he looked over his shoulder and
beheld the advancing squadron.</p>

<p>“To allow us to share the pleasure of
entertaining them, of course,” responded
Miss Ferrars in her most affable manner.</p>

<p>“Does the old lady with the parrot beak
call that thing on her head a bonnet, or
a bewitched bird’s-nest?” whispered Geoffrey,
as she slowly and majestically approached
the group under the trees—in fact, her
mode of progression gave one the idea that
she was on castors, and being pushed along
over the turf like a heavy piece of furniture.</p>

<p>Alice introduced Mrs. Pritchard and Mrs.
Blundell to Miss Ferrars.</p>

<p>“My cousins, Mr. Mayhew and Mr.
Saville,” she said, indicating the two reclining
gentlemen, who sprang up, bowed themselves,
and again subsided. Mrs. Blundell
and Mrs. Pritchard having executed leisurely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
and patronising bows all round, sank into
two roomy garden-chairs, and permitted
themselves to be refreshed with cups of
tea.</p>

<p>Sir Reginald, who had been collecting
stray bats and balls, now joined the group,
and doffing his hat politely to the new
arrivals, made some trivial remark with
respect to that fail-me-never topic, the
weather. He seemed to take it for granted
that they would recognise him as their
host, and dispensed tea, claret-cup, and
strawberries to the best of his ability.</p>

<p>Geoffrey still remained prone on the
grass, making no attempt to share his
labours, and apparently spell-bound by
Mrs. Blundell’s appearance.</p>

<p>But Reginald’s efforts at hospitality were
not favourably received by the two lady
guests: their gaze was that of stony interrogation,
their answers brevity itself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span></p>

<p>“<i>Who</i>,” they asked themselves, “was
this handsome young fellow in the cricketing
flannels and straw hat with a zingari
ribbon, so suspiciously at his ease—so
entirely at home? Had their ears deceived
them, or had he called Lady Fairfax by her
christian-name?”</p>

<p>“No sugar, Alice—no sugar,” in an easy
authoritative tone, that spoke whole volumes
of the closest intimacy.</p>

<p>No tea for young Mr. Blundell—no, no,
his most ardent desire was to have a game
of tennis with Lady Fairfax—a desire by
no means warmly reciprocated. Nevertheless,
she good-naturedly left the cool
shade once more in order to gratify his
wishes.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the two ladies engaged the
rest of the party in desultory languid
conversation.</p>

<p>Mrs. Blundell was a very stout pompous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
old woman, whose skin somehow had the
appearance of being too tight for her face.
A pair of rolling little pig’s eyes took in
every object with microscopic detail; in
fact, they had a double duty to perform,
as their owner was exceedingly deaf, and
in every case brought the eye to the rescue
of the ear. She not only had to be
roared at, but roared herself in reply; and
what she flattered herself was an inaudible
whisper was generally as loud as ordinary
conversation, and as she indulged her friend
and toady, Mrs. Pritchard, with many of
these supposed <i>sotto voce</i> remarks, the
result can be better imagined than described.
A most gorgeous yellow bonnet
adorned Mrs. Blundell’s hoary head. To
an inexperienced eye it appeared a mad
rendezvous of flowers, beads, and feathers.
A very voluminous satin mantle enshrouded
her matronly form—a mantle that would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
have been a mine of wealth to an Indian
squaw being a prey to the all-pervading
bead, and one mass of steel fringes, tassels,
and trimmings. So much for her outward
woman.</p>

<p>Mrs. Blundell had a threefold object in
visiting Monkswood; she came, firstly, to
gratify her son, who had been immensely
smitten with Lady Fairfax’s appearance,
and who yearned to make her personal
acquaintance; secondly, she came to indulge
herself in the proud consciousness that
she, Mrs. Blundell, a mere nobody—retired
soap, in fact—had it in her power to
countenance and patronise the wife of one
of the most blue-blooded magnates in Steepshire,
to take her under her protecting wing,
give her some sage matronly advice, and,
perchance, lead the wicked little stray lamb
back into the fold of society; and thirdly,
she came to satisfy the cravings of a sound<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
wholesome curiosity, to see for herself if
all tales were true, to look with her own
keen little eyes within the massive, rarely-opened,
grand entrance-gates of Monkswood.</p>

<p>Now all speculation was completely set at
rest; seeing was believing, and she beheld
plain unvarnished facts. Never would she
tolerate, patronise, or countenance her
present hostess, never again darken her
doors. Meanwhile, as she <i>was</i> here, she
would make the most of her time, the best
of her opportunities—were some of her
charitable reflections. It was not every
day that the very fount of scandal itself
was laid open to her judicial eye. Here
was no second-hand sight, but a most
piquant improper little drama being
played before her very face. In other
words, she saw Lady Fairfax indisputably
gay and pretty and well dressed, entertaining,
in her husband’s absence, three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
men, all drinking tea or claret-cup, eating
strawberries, and lolling on the grass, with
the air of being most thoroughly at home;
and there was an easy familiarity in
their bearing towards each other, and
specially towards their hostess, that was
absolutely revolting to Mrs. Blundell’s
sense of propriety—the fair young man
had actually rapped her over the knuckles
with the sugar-tongs! Where was the old
chaperon?—a myth or a dummy most
probably; no creature of the female sex
was visible, excepting that bold-looking
red-haired young woman, who had been
riding about the roads with Lady Fairfax
the whole summer. These thoughts flashed
like lightning through the good lady’s mind
as her eyes looked from one to the other,
storing up her memory with a distinct
mental photograph of the whole scene.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pritchard, Mrs. Blundell, and Miss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
Ferrars occupied wicker garden-chairs; the
three gentlemen reposed in the foreground
on the grass, but a sense of politeness had
raised them to a sitting position. The
weather, and tennis, as a popular and
healthy game, had been alike exhausted,
and conversation flagged visibly, in spite
of Mary’s gallant exertions.</p>

<p>“Why were you not at the grand cricket-match
in Manister yesterday?” asked Mrs.
Blundell in a loud authoritative tone.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, I’m sure; we never
thought of it,” replied Miss Ferrars
meekly.</p>

<p>“If you had it would not have done
you much good,” put in Geoffrey; “there
are no carriage-horses. I never knew such
a little duffer as Alice—sending them
back to Looton,” he added in a low aside.</p>

<p>“No carriage-horses!” echoed Mrs. Blundell,
whose ears had at least caught <i>that</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
sentence. “Dear me! you don’t say so?”
in a tone of deep commiseration. Then
turning aside to her friend she whispered (?):
“I heard he kept her tight, but I had no
idea it was as bad as that.”</p>

<p>Mary, Geoffrey, and Mr. Mayhew exchanged
looks of unqualified amazement,
and again an awkward silence ensued.</p>

<p>Mrs. Blundell once more proceeded in a
louder and more <i>forte</i> key:</p>

<p>“I am surprised to see Lady Fairfax
entertaining visitors; I had no idea she
ever had people staying here.”</p>

<p>“We are the exception that proves the
rule,” replied Geoffrey at the top of his
naturally robust organ.</p>

<p>“Are <i>you</i> staying in the house—you
two young men?” indicating Geoffrey and
Reginald with a fat forefinger.</p>

<p>“Yes,” returned Geoffrey, who had taken
upon himself the task of answering.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span></p>

<p>“Ah! I do not think I know your face,”
to Geoffrey. “Are you in the Manister
Bank?” patronisingly.</p>

<p>“No, I’m not;” rather sharply.</p>

<p>“Do you belong to this part of the
country?”</p>

<p>“I have not that honour.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Blundell gazed at him dreamily for
nearly sixty seconds, and then a light
seemed to break, for she exclaimed with
the triumph of one who has grasped and
presents an indisputable fact:</p>

<p>“I have it! You are the new young
man in the Brewery.”</p>

<p>“I am <i>not</i>,” returned Geoffrey haughtily,
and shouting with impressive distinctness.
“I am not in the Brewery; and to save
you the trouble of further speculation on
my behalf, I may as well inform you that
I’m in the cavalry.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” There was a world of meaning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
in that interjection—a meaning no pen
could convey. “And he?” indicating
Reginald with her sunshade.</p>

<p>“Cavalry officer also.”</p>

<p>“Two cavalry officers,” she repeated
slowly, evidently rehearsing the intelligence
for future occasions. If she had said,
“Two returned convicts,” her intonation
could not have expressed deeper disapproval.</p>

<p>Whilst she was gratifying her thirst for
information, her friend and Mrs. Mayhew
were exchanging platitudes about flowers
and fruit, the seasons of the year, and
suchlike enthralling topics. They now
made a combined effort to include her in
their conversation. But it was of no
avail; she evidently preferred to draw out
Geoffrey, who seemed not merely willing,
but delighted to oblige her.</p>

<p>Having replenished her cup with politest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
alacrity, he resumed his seat in front of her
<i>à la Turc</i>, and looked up at her with an
amused twinkle in his mischievous little
hazel eyes.</p>

<p>“Lady Fairfax is a very pretty young
woman,” she remarked to him over her
teacup. A nod satisfied her of Geoffrey’s
cordial assent. “My son admires her
immensely, so do all the gentlemen about
here. She is rather what I call a gentleman’s
beauty,” she added in a deprecating
tone; “but still <i>I</i> think her decidedly
good-looking,” with an air that signified
that Alice had now, and once for all,
received an invaluable <i>cachet</i> of distinction.</p>

<p>“Very kind of you, I’m sure,” muttered
Geoffrey.</p>

<p>“Frederick has been most anxious for me
to call ever since he met Lady Fairfax one
day out riding; he has been dying to make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
her acquaintance. He has such an eye for
beauty.”</p>

<p>“He looks like it,” assented Geoffrey in a
cheerful shout.</p>

<p>“Be quiet, Geoffrey,” muttered Reginald
from behind.</p>

<p>“Are you any relation to Lady Fairfax,
may I ask?”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course I am,” roared Geoffrey.</p>

<p>“Both of you? Cousins did you say?”</p>

<p>“No, I did not; but I <i>am</i> her cousin.”</p>

<p>“As much her cousin as I am,” in a
loud aside to her friend, and with a
significance baffling all description.</p>

<p>Mary, seeing a storm brewing in
Reginald’s eyes, hastened to throw herself
into the breach with an all-absorbing bazaar
for bait. But no, the devoted old lady
madly rushed on her fate. After a few
brief replies she resumed:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span></p>

<p>“Did you say that this other gentleman
was a cousin also?” regarding Geoffrey with
a keen satirical eye.</p>

<p>“The interest you take in Lady Fairfax
is most gratifying to the whole family.
No, he is <i>not</i> her cousin, he is her
husband.”</p>

<p>“Not her cousin, not her husband! You
need not tell me <i>that</i>; of course I know
<i>that</i>,” with insolent emphasis.</p>

<p>What was to be done with this terrible
old woman, on whom her friend’s signs and
nudges were entirely thrown away?</p>

<p>At this instant, the game over, Alice,
flushed and breathless, joined the group.</p>

<p>“I won, Geoff; only—fancy—that,” she
said, laying her hands on his shoulders in
the excitement of her recent victory.</p>

<p>“Then, I suppose, there will be no living
in the same house with you for the next
week,” remarked her cousin, moving so as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
to make room for her beside him on the
grass.</p>

<p>She looked utterly fagged and exhausted;
her frail delicate appearance struck her
husband forcibly, and for the first time
he sprang up, dragged forward a garden-chair,
and, taking her by the arm, pushed
her into it with an air of loverlike
solicitude—by no means lost on Mrs.
Blundell—that had been foreign to his
manner for many a long day.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Reginald,” said Alice, sinking
back into the seat with a sigh of relief
and removing her hat. “To reward you
for your politeness you shall have a little bit
of my dress to sit on,” spreading out the
folds of her skirt.</p>

<p>“This is really too barefaced,” cried
Mrs. Blundell in one of her very loudest
asides.</p>

<p>Then, getting up and extending her hand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
very stiffly to Alice, she said in a most
pointed unmistakable manner:</p>

<p>“It is quite time for me to be going,
Lady Fairfax. I wish you good-afternoon.
Come, Frederick,” she called to her son,
who was quaffing quantities of claret-cup,
“I am ready,” and with a comprehensive
bow she was sailing off, but was arrested
by Sir Reginald, who, leaping to his feet,
confronted her.</p>

<p>“Before you leave, madam, will you have
the goodness to tell me <i>who</i> you think I
am?”</p>

<p>With a most evil and significant smile
she was turning away, and metaphorically
proceeding to shake the dust off her feet,
when he again detained her.</p>

<p>“I am Lady Fairfax’s <i>husband</i>!” he
shouted. “What do you mean by your
looks and innuendoes?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span></p>

<p>“What is he saying, Frederick? I can’t
hear a word.”</p>

<p>Reginald, turning to her son, with
eyes ablaze and perfectly livid with passion,
said to the electrified youth: “Be
good enough to make your mother understand
<i>who</i> I am; also make her clearly
comprehend that neither Lady Fairfax nor
myself have any further desire for her
acquaintance. As for <i>you</i>”—with withering
contempt—“I sincerely hope your
curiosity has been gratified with regard to
my wife’s appearance. That there may be
no delay in your departure”—looking at
the three culprits sternly—“I shall myself
go and order your carriage.”</p>

<p>So saying, he took off his hat and walked
away, leaving his visitors covered with
amazement and confusion, Geoffrey in
agonies of repressed laughter, and Miss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
Ferrars and Mrs. Mayhew in a state of
mental coma.</p>

<p>When this tirade had been interpreted
to Mrs. Blundell—she had heard a good
deal more than she pretended—she returned
across the grass, from where she was awaiting
her carriage, and humbly accosting Alice,
overwhelmed her with excuses and apologies
which there was no avoiding. The worldly-wise
old lady said to herself: “It will never
do to quarrel with the Fairfaxes—people
of great wealth and influence, if all is as it
seems. Supposing her outrageous mistake
was to get about, what capital for her
fellow-gossips! At all costs she would leave
on friendly terms, and be literally stone
deaf to every snub.” Summoning a sweet
smile to her discomfited countenance, she
implored Alice to intercede with her husband:
“He looks as if he could refuse you
<i>nothing</i>. Do make my peace with him; do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
go and bring him to receive my most
humble apologies. You must blame my
unfortunate deafness, not me. I am not
like other people, my dear young lady; I
am afflicted, and I frequently get hold of
wrong impressions, which is my great misfortune—not,
I am sure you will allow, my
fault. I did hear a little idle whisper that
you were rather—a—rather—a——” casting
wildly about for a delicate way of
expressing herself, and becoming crimson in
the attempt—“shall we say—fast young
lady?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, if you like; and as long as I
need not agree to the fact,” returned Alice
with much composure.</p>

<p>“Well, and finding you entertaining
<i>three</i> cavalry officers, all on a most familiar
footing, and imagining that your husband
was still absent, I just thought, as a
much older married woman”—effusively—“I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
would give you a little hint by my
manner.”</p>

<p>“In that she succeeded to a marvel,”
murmured Geoffrey.</p>

<p>“And I had no idea, no more than the
man in the moon, of the real state of the
case; nor that that dark distinguished-looking
young man was Sir Reginald
himself. And has he come to stay? and
where has he been all this time?” she
asked with affectionate solicitude. “However,
I’ll question you another time. Do
run after him and obtain my forgiveness;
I assure you I cannot leave the place without
it,” planting her parasol in a typical
manner in the sod and waving Alice to
the quest.</p>

<p>Alice most unwillingly set out to find
her husband; he was in the yard composing
himself with a cigar, and personally
despatching the carriage. When he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
heard what she had to say he burst
forth:</p>

<p>“Alice, I am astonished that you can
ask such a thing. No, I certainly will not
forgive them; and if you say another word
on the subject, I warn you that I shall
begin to swear. I feel literally boiling
with rage. Nothing less than a swim in
the river will cool me,” he observed, moving
off.</p>

<p>“Stay one instant,” she cried, running
after him. “What <i>am</i> I to say to them,
then?”</p>

<p>“Say? Oh say that I am in such a
frightful rage you are afraid to go near
me.”</p>

<p>“But you are not quite so bad as all that,
and I am not the least afraid of you,” she
returned with a smile.</p>

<p>“Are you not?” he said, taking his
cheroot out of his mouth and looking hard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
at her. “Well, you may go back and tell
them that I forgive them this time for your
sake, since you say that nothing else will
induce the old woman to quit the premises.”</p>

<p>“You will not come back and say so
yourself?” she asked insinuatingly.</p>

<p>“Not for ten thousand pounds; my
forgiveness is but hollow. I should like
nothing better than to give that young
booby a thrashing that would surprise
him, and to duck his mother in the pond.
Such are my savage instincts. That is what
I would do if I were a North American
Indian and you were my squaw,” he
concluded with a grim smile.</p>

<p>“Reginald, I think you have taken leave
of your senses.”</p>

<p>“I see one thing very plainly,” he
continued, walking by her side to the
edge of the lawn, “and that is, that I
shall have to stay here much longer than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
I intended, to rehabilitate you in the good
opinion of society. So be prepared to
enact with me in public the part of a
most united happy couple. Do you understand?”
he said, throwing the end of his
cigar among the laurel bushes and coming
to a full stop. “I will accompany you
everywhere, carry your fans, shawls,
bouquets, and other loose paraphernalia,
and you”—very bitterly—“must assume a
certain amount of interest and gratitude
in return for my devoted solicitude. It will
only be for a short time, but I see that
it is an imperative though disagreeable
necessity.”</p>

<p>So saying, he turned abruptly away down
a side walk, leaving Alice with tears of
mortification smarting in her eyes.</p>

</div>


<p>An hour later Reginald made his appearance
in the library, where he found all the
party assembled except Alice. Seeing him
look round the room, Helen volunteered to
tell him that she had gone to see a sick
girl.</p>

<p>“What, at this time of night?”</p>

<p>“She went nearly an hour ago. She
insisted on going, as she had not been to
see Lucy Summers for some days. Alice
has been so good to her all the summer—she
is dying of consumption, poor girl.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span></p>

<p>“It is quite time that Alice was home,”
said her husband with authority. “Half-past
seven!” walking to the window and
looking at his watch.</p>

<p>“Geoffrey promised to fetch her. You
ought to start, Geoff,” said Helen. “You
know that this is market-night, and her
abject fear of drunken men is no secret.”</p>

<p>“She need not go as far as the road for
them,” remarked Reginald. “Just now I
met an under-gardener endeavouring to
walk up both sides of the avenue at
once.”</p>

<p>“Come, Geoff, you had better be off if
you are going.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m exhausted,” replied Geoffrey.
“I really could not think of taking any
more exercise to-day.”</p>

<p>“But you promised,” urged his cousin
emphatically.</p>

<p>“Promised, did I?” he replied, rising<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
languidly and deliberately arranging a
cushion behind his head as he settled
himself into the snuggest corner of the
sofa. “Oh, Alice is accustomed to my
promises by this time; she knows they are
like piecrust—made to be broken. Besides,
Alice has a young and active husband.
Pedestrian exercise is good for these Anglo-Indians;
let him go.”</p>

<p>“But, Geoffrey——”</p>

<p>“‘But me no buts;’ I won’t stir till the
first bell rings, if then. That girl has
already run me off my legs, and if she is
mad enough to start for a two-miles’ walk
at this time of night, I am not. I prefer
lying here”—shutting his eyes—“and
thinking of dinner.”</p>

<p>“Well, Geoffrey,” exclaimed Reginald
indignantly, taking up his hat, “if you
won’t go, <i>I</i> must. Where does this sick
girl live?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span></p>

<p>“Go out by the lower avenue, turn to
the left, and follow your nose—it’s straight,
isn’t it?—till you come to a plantation; go
through that, and you will see a field, and
in the field a cottage. And you had better
look sharp, my dear boy; it’s getting late.”</p>

<p>As the door closed, Geoffrey started up
and began capering about the room.</p>

<p>“Did I not do that splendidly?” he
asked, stopping and rubbing his hands.
“Haven’t I arranged for a nice little
conjugal <i>tête-à-tête</i>, and isn’t he just
swearing at me! Ten to one they will
have a battle-royal, but anything is better
than this armed peace; the way in which
they avoid each other is a most beautiful
study in tactics.”</p>

<p>“If you will take <i>my</i> advice,” observed
Mrs. Mayhew, “you will not put
your finger in the pie. Leave it to time,
and it will all come right.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t agree with you there,” replied
Geoffrey. “Leave all to time and it will
all go wrong, unless time is assisted by
kind friends who make such judicious
arrangements as this walk for example.
They require as much looking after as if it
were a half-developed love affair.”</p>

<p>“Why should you busy yourself about
them, an unfledged youngster like you?”
asked the Honorable Mark peevishly.</p>

<p>Perfectly ignoring the question, Geoffrey
stalked over to Helen, delightfully unconscious
that an antimacassar was clinging
to his coat-tails.</p>

<p>“Helen, now that we are here, ‘<i>en champ
clos</i>’—or to translate it freely, Miss Ferrars
and auntie are gone to dress, and the master
and mistress are out—tell me honestly what
you think about the business—will it all
come right, or will he hook it off to the wars
again?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span></p>

<p>“What a way of expressing yourself!
What polished ease! Well, if you want
my opinion, you are quite welcome to it.
I think the prospect is decidedly gloomy.”</p>

<p>“You do? Well, listen to me—I am
certain that his cool indifference is only
assumed—is that nicely expressed?—and,
as to her, I daresay she is quite ready to
kiss and be friends. Suppose you break
the ice with her, and I’ll put out a feeler
in his direction?”</p>

<p>“Helen,” almost shouted her husband,
“don’t attempt to interfere, whatever
Geoffrey may do—and he has assurance for
twenty. But you’ll see he will only burn
his fingers,” added Mr. Mayhew emphatically.</p>

<p>“Never mind him, Helen, you back <i>me</i>
up,” urged Geoffrey eagerly.</p>

<p>Helen merely shook her head in reply.</p>

<p>“Pouff! Mr. Mayhew,” he expostulated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
indignantly, “I had a much better opinion
of you. You have no pluck!”</p>

<p>So saying, he lounged out of the room,
banging the door loudly after him.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.<br><span class="small">“MEET ME BY MOONLIGHT ALONE.”</span></h2>
</div>


<p>In the meantime, Sir Reginald was walking
rapidly in the direction of the Summers’
cottage. He reached the wood, which was
thickly planted, and covered about an acre
of ground. Spruce and fir made it dusky
even in the daytime, and now in the twilight
it was almost pitch-dark. Vaulting
over the stile, he followed a path till he
came to another stile, near which was the
cottage, as Geoffrey had described.</p>

<p>“I’ve come far enough,” he said to himself,
“and whilst I wait I’ll have a smoke.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
So, leaning against a tree, he struck a light,
and lit at least his sixth cigar that day.
After five minutes or so he saw the cottage
door open, and a white dog and a slender
white figure emerge, both of which started
off at a brisk run across the field, Alice
collapsing to a sober walk as she neared the
plantation. Stepping lightly over the stile,
she advanced cautiously through the gloom,
but descrying the spark at the end of
her husband’s cheroot, she exclaimed, as
she sprang towards him and seized his
arm:</p>

<p>“Oh, Geoff! you good boy, I was half
afraid you would not come. I never was
more glad to see you—I do so hate this
lonely dark wood. They say a murder was
committed here years ago,” she added, drawing
closer to him and shuddering. “Come,
we must be quick,” she chattered on; “I shall
get into dreadful hot water, I am so late,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
and I am so tired I can hardly crawl. Not
that I mind, only Helen makes such a fuss
if she sees me looking pale and sleepy.
Why don’t you speak, you lazy fellow?
you are always smoking. Who would think
you had such an arm,” pinching him; “it’s
like a blacksmith’s; the muscles feel as if
they would burst the sleeve of your coat.
I shall have no compunction in leaning
pretty heavily, I can tell you.”</p>

<p>“Are you dumb, Geoffrey; or are you
in the sulks?”</p>

<p>A sudden idea struck her. It was
<i>not</i> Geoffrey after all; perhaps—agonising
thought!—it was some utter stranger whom
she had thus cavalierly appropriated.</p>

<p>“What <i>have</i> I done?” she cried, horror-struck,
and endeavouring to release her
hand. “Please let me go, whoever you
are,” she pleaded piteously.</p>

<p>By this time they were close to the road,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
and by the light of the newly-risen moon
she saw her husband, and stood aghast.</p>

<p>“Geoffrey was, or said he was, too lazy
to come,” he remarked, helping her over
the stile, “so I came as his substitute. I
daresay you will find my arm quite as
efficient a support,” coolly replacing her
hand.</p>

<p>“Oh, but indeed,” struggling to withdraw
it, and struggling in vain, “I never
dreamt it was you, or I would not—I would
not——”</p>

<p>“Have taken such a liberty,” he interrupted.
“No, I daresay not.”</p>

<p>“There is no necessity to show me such
politeness now,” she exclaimed hotly; “it
is only in public, as you said yourself, that
you are to pay me any attention. Let
my hand go, please; I can walk very well
without any assistance.”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, as you admitted just now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
that you were tired, you will have to do
violence to your feelings for once and accept
my arm, much as you dislike it; and if the
high road is not a public place, I should
like to know what is. Why did you not
defer this visit till to-morrow? No wonder
you are tired, after playing lawn-tennis all
the afternoon. What can have possessed
you to take such a walk?” he asked,
slackening his pace.</p>

<p>“I could not have slept,” she rejoined,
“if I had not, for I had not been to see
Lucy for a week, and my conscience was
telling me I had neglected her.”</p>

<p>“Oh then you <i>have</i> a conscience?” he
observed gravely.</p>

<p>“Of course I have. What an odd question!
Why do you ask?”</p>

<p>“Mere idle curiosity. Who is this Lucy
Summers you have been to see?”</p>

<p>“A girl who is very ill; she thinks so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
much of my visits, poor thing; but she
does me far more good than I have it in
my power to do her. She is truly fit for
heaven, if anyone can be so.”</p>

<p>“She is dying, is she not?”</p>

<p>“Yes, of consumption; and she is only
my age. If I were like her I should be
glad to go—only for Maurice.”</p>

<p>A long and truly eloquent silence, lasting
for fully a quarter of a mile. Alice thought
of the last time they had walked together
arm-in-arm up and down the long gallery
at Looton, the evening before he had started
for Cannes. What an age it seemed since
then! What changes had occurred! He
was more changed than all else, she felt,
as she stole a glance at him. His clear-cut
profile looked coldly severe in the moonlight,
his eyes were fixed on the horizon,
and his thoughts seemed at least a thousand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
miles away. The moon, which had risen
behind the park trees, was now sailing
proudly overhead, and looked down full-faced
on this strangely-silent couple.</p>

<p>The rattle of an approaching dog-cart
and the sound of a horse’s hoofs aroused
them from their reflections.</p>

<p>Two young men in evening dress,
evidently going out to dinner. They
favoured Alice with a hard stare, and
Reginald with a knowing look, as they
dashed past.</p>

<p>“Pretty girl!” and “Lucky dog!” was
borne upon the breeze as they rounded a
corner, leaving behind them a cloud of
dust.</p>

<p>As Alice put up her hand to ward off
a volume of it, her wedding-ring glittered
in the moonlight, and, for the first time,
caught her husband’s eye.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span></p>

<p>“So you have replaced your wedding-ring,
I see,” he observed, as they entered
the avenue-gates.</p>

<p>“I have,” she replied in a low voice.</p>

<p>“What an interesting ceremony it must
have been,” he remarked sarcastically.</p>

<p>“What <i>do</i> you mean?” asked Alice,
gazing up at him with unrestrained astonishment.</p>

<p>“Did you swear to love, honour, and
obey Alice Fairfax? I have often heard
of people being wedded to self, but such an
utterly barefaced proceeding as yours I
never met with before.”</p>

<p>Alice had never thoroughly realised till
now how bitterly he had resented her treatment
of his wedding-ring.</p>

<p>“Where is my own ring?” she asked
with a reckless boldness that surprised
herself.</p>

<p>“I wear it on my watch-chain.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span></p>

<p>“Will you ever give it back to me?”
she inquired, more and more amazed at her
own audacity.</p>

<p>He paused and stood still for a moment,
and eyeing his wife with cool unspeakable
amazement, said:</p>

<p>“Will I give you back your wedding-ring?
When you deserve it I may; but,”
he added slowly and impressively, “as far
as I can judge at present, that will
<i>never</i> be.”</p>

<p>He felt her little hand tremble on his
arm, he saw her lips quiver, a mist come
over her deep-fringed eyes. Seized with
sudden compunction, he said:</p>

<p>“I am afraid I am always giving you
rude brusque answers, but you brought this
on yourself. The past three years have not
been calculated to improve a man’s temper,
have they?”</p>

<p>She looked up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span></p>

<p>“You know you don’t deserve your
wedding-ring, do you?” said he, taking
her hand. “Do you?” he added pertinaciously.</p>

<p>“I suppose not,” faltered Alice, gulping
down her tears with a painful effort.</p>

<p>“You <i>suppose</i> not!” he echoed impatiently.
“Well, I am very certain you
don’t; and the ring is likely to remain in
my keeping.”</p>

<p>By this time they had reached the hall
door-steps, where Geoffrey, in full evening
dress and the usual flower in his button-hole,
was awaiting them.</p>

<p>“At last!” he exclaimed. “So you have
really come home. Well, you did not
hurry yourselves,” he said, escorting them
into the hall. “We began to think you
had eloped—gone off together into some
elegant retirement in the style of a second
honeymoon.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span></p>

<p>“Geoffrey!” cried Alice, in an agony of
blushes.</p>

<p>“Don’t ‘Geoffrey’ me, my good girl, but
go and get ready for dinner as quickly as
you can; I’m <i>starving</i>.”</p>
